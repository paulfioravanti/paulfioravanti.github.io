  Time to attempt to start another blog.

After finishing [_Learn Enough CSS & Layout to Be Dangerous_][learn-enough-css]
by [Michael Hartl][mhartl], where you create CSS styling and HTML templates for
a [Jekyll][jekyll] blog, I decided that it was probably for the best that I
finally have my own site to write on, and also use as a sandbox to tinker
with front-end programming languages.

The last time I attempted to start up a blog was after reading
[_Technical Blogging_][technical-blogging] a few years ago. Although it was
a good read, I didn't feel much love for the [Wordpress][wordpress] site I was
left with after finishing, and probably didn't feel like I had much to write
about anyway. It was left neglected, unloved, and eventually taken down with a
single "Hello Blog!" post to its name. Hopefully things will be a bit different
this time as I have more manual control over this
[Github Pages][github-pages]-hosted Jekyll-powered blog.

I didn't want to throw away the result of the _Learn Enough_ tutorial,
as I made a few changes I think I will want to reference later, so I
[moved the codebase repository][learn-enough-css-repo], took it off
Github Pages, and instead deployed it using [Heroku][heroku] to its
[new home][learn-enough-css-heroku].

So, hello (again) blog, and here's to a new start :beers:
