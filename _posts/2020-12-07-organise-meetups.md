In my previous post, _[Speak at a Meetup][]_, I attempted to convince you that
actively participating and delivering talks at your local technical meetup is A
Good Thing that you definitely Want To Try.

I will assume the pitch was a :sparkles: great success :sparkles:, and you have
been attending, participating, and even speaking at meetups; receiving
accolades, and the admiration of your peers.

Now, perhaps, you would like to stretch your meetup wings a bit further, give
back to your community, or even just get some event management experience.

Well, becoming a meetup organiser ticks all of those boxes! So, this post aims
to:

- Pitch the benefits of becoming a meetup organiser
- Share some anecdotes and experiences of my time as an organiser
- Share my ideas and opinions around preparing for and holding meetups for your
  consideration

relevant again), but even when they do, there are definitely elements from
online meetups that I intend to bring into [meatspace][], which I will further
elaborate on later.

## Why become an organiser?

At a past [Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney (RORO)][] meetup, the organisers
starting asking some participants if they would consider becoming organisers
themselves, and effectively take over running the meetup (I seem to recall
the reasons being due to the demands of raising a young family, and competing
time commitments for work, which is fair enough).

Before being asked, organising was not something I had thought about doing at
all. It was great being a participant and a member of a community, and I did not
feel actively compelled to seek out what seemed like more work. However, by the
end of the meetup, I had signed up for the following reasons:

- It would be a new experience. I had never done any other kind of event
  organising before, so I decided to silence all internal dissenting voices,
  throw myself out of my comfort zone, see what would happen, and hopefully
  learn something along the way.
- Giving back would be a good thing. The very evening I moved permanently to
  Sydney, Australia, a place where I had no family and few friends, I made a
  beeline directly for the [Ruby][] community, and was welcomed. Over time,
  I gave talks, mentored new developers, made new friends, and had lots of fun.
  I felt that this was a community worth maintaining and contributing to.
- More public speaking. I figured that becoming an organiser would essentially
  force me to have a regular speaking gig, and help keep those vocal skills
  sharp.

After nearly two years of being a RORO organiser, I took on further organiser
roles at the [Elixir Sydney][], [GraphQL Sydney][], and [Elm Sydney][] meetups,
of which I am still an organiser of at the time of this writing. This required
me to pass on my RORO torch on to a new team of amazing people, as four meetups
became a bit too much for me to handle (it is good to be cognizant of your
personal limits!).

I have no regrets on having travelled down the organiser path, and find that I
still enjoy doing it. I get tremendous personal satisfaction from being able to
provide a platform for others to speak about all the awesome stuff they have
been doing, helping them in constructing their talks, or just being a sound
board for works-in-progress.

Meetups are all about community, and their management teams benefit greatly from
a wide range of ideas and experiences, including yours. So, if you ever have the
opportunity to be the enabler of those sparks of enthusiasm, I would encourage
you to give it a try!

### Okay, I'm In! Now what?

If you want to know what kind of things you could help out with, or you want
some ideas around what to include when starting your own meetup, read on, and
hopefully the following will be of some reference as you take the reins and
start leading your community.

## Content is King

No half measures, let's start with what I consider the hardest part of
organising a technical meetup, regardless of whether it is in-person or online:
sourcing talks.

The dream for an organiser is to have a full pipeline of talks by willing and
able speakers on a wide variety of topics that will cover multiple months worth
of meetups. You then have the luxury of being able to do things like grouping
talks by theme or technology.

I remember I once had a pipeline of talks that covered a present _and_
subsequent month's meetups, and it felt _amazing_! Good times...

So, yes, few organisers get to live the dream, but I am certainly not
discouraged by that. Regardless of how much I may regurgitate the benefits I
pitch in _[Speak at a Meetup][]_, I know I am making a Big Ask when I canvass
the community for presentations. I am essentially asking you to:

- take time out of your schedule to work for free by creating a talk (sorry,
  neither myself nor sponsors can pay you)
- take more time out of your schedule to refine and practice your talk
- maybe take even more time out of your schedule to have companion technical
  materials like code repositories available
- do something that you may not have experience doing and initially may be
  uncomfortable, or just not like, doing
- feel gratified that content creation is its own reward, and believe that the
  audience response will justify your time and effort

I know I'm just some guy on the internet, but would you do that for me...? Maybe
next month, then...? Well, have a think about it and let's talk again later!

## Information Source of Truth

Technical meetups generate a bunch of information:

- That people gathered together at a specific time and place for a purpose
- A list of speakers, their talk summaries, and the materials they used for
  their talks
- Typically, a meetup organiser slide deck
- Artefacts like videos
- Github repo, not Meetup.com

## Meetup should exist as its own entity

## Logo

- Not required, but it would be nice to get one


## Presentation Deck

- Deckset
- Markdown in Github, README, always add PDF deck
- Get speaker photos so you can put them in slide decks, and they double as YouTube video thumbnails
  - Put speaker photo, talk name, speaker name, Twitter handle
- Welcome new people
- Ensure that date for next meetup is included in deck

## Beginner content
- Currently use Exercism
- Encourage junior developers/students to come; they are your future
- Reach out to universities, bootcamps and perhaps offer to do a talk there and promote the meetup
  - Community outreach

## Steal from other Meetups

## Canvassing Talks

- Talk pipelines are the dream
  - Be more selective about what talks go before your audience
  - Perhaps even organise talks that have a similar theme and bunch them together
- Make requests on Twitter
- Reach out directly and nudge
- If anyone puts anything in Slack or Twitter about a project they did, reach
out and offer them a spot in the speaker line up
- Offer any kind of help and assistance you can. Your job is to make your speakers look amazing on stage, real or virtual.
- Vetting speakers. Always give potential speakers the benefit of the doubt, but if you have a speaker who
  ignores meetup decorum, whether time or content, consider vetting future submissions from them

## Use of External Websites for Assets

- Meetup.com
- Github organisation/repo
- Github (issues); life-cycle of an issue
  - add templates to guide people through full-length, lightning talks, requests
  - use assignments and milestones
  - encourage sharing of materials
  - reference issue in README
  - add links to videos/slide decks as speakers share them
- Email
  - Don't use personal email: create a new one for the meetup
- Slack
- Zoom
- Twitter
  - get speakers to tweet out their materials, and re-tweet
- Dropbox
- YouTube
- Secret Information
  - 1password
  - Share information via Keybase

## In-Person Meetups

### Post Meetup
- Pub/Gelato

## Scheduling
- How long for each talk?
- Try and emphasise that speakers should time and practice their talks before delivering
- What to do if talks run long

## Food/Drink
- What is the budget?
- Pizza easiest option, but there are others
  - Corporate catering
  - Chicken wings, cold rolls
  - Take care to cater for diverse dietary options (vegetarian/vegan options)
- Do you want to be alcohol free? If not, make sure to have non-alcoholic options, even if just water.
- Where to order food/drinks and how to pay and/or get reimbursed?
- Watch out for food hogs
- Encourage people to bring food containers to prevent too much wastage

## Sponsors

## Venue

Must Haves:
- Room for 80 people to at least stand
- Projector/Big Screen
- Cables for projector/screen to laptops
- Ability for food to be delivered (street parking/elevators/docking area/trollies etc)
- Tables/[trestles][Trestle Table] where catered food can be placed
- Rubbish bins to dispose of food/cutlery/crockery
- Access to male/female toilets
- Ability for people to get in to the venue if they come late

Nice to Haves:
- Ability to provide disposable cutlery/crockery for food
- Ability to sponsor drinks/open up their drinks fridge
- Room for 80 people to sit on chairs
- Lectern
- Microphone/Sound systems
- Provide remote controls for presentations
- Ability to record presentations
- Ability to have a table to put name tags on to place
 near the entrance

- Close to public transport

## Logistics

## Online

- Zoom account
- Record meetup
- Edit talks
- Post to YouTube and promote on Twitter
- Have people on mute unless they're speaking or asking a question of the speaker at an appropriate time

## Jobs section

- Before or after the talks?

## Meetup pitch

ROROSyd is the long-running meetup group for Ruby/Ruby on Rails enthusiasts and practitioners in Sydney.
Every month we get a group together to do technical talks, usually two 15 minute talks and two 5 minute lightning talks,
and the meetup host updates the group with the Ruby-related news and events that have been happening in the community.
Ruby Australia (https://ruby.org.au/) is our governing body, and provides budget for food catering, and the event host will
usually also provide drinks, but if not, we can secure a drinks sponsor.
More information about past meetups can be found at: https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/
We manage all our talks on our Github repo here: https://github.com/rails-oceania/roro

## Problem Solving

- Code of conduct?
- "Fit birds"

## Insurance?
- RORO insurance

## Community outreach

## Succession Planning

## Steal from other meetups

- SydCSS
- SydJS
- React Sydney

One of my favourite things about being involved in technology is the meetups.
The best ones are like school yards for adults, where friends can be made easily
cause we all know we have similar interests, and have gathered for the explicit
purpose of learning more and talking about them.

They are not structured "networking" events, where we are meant to deliberately
spend time making small talk with random people to figure out if they would help
make us money, get us a job, or generally be of use to us in the future somehow
(though that is a not uncommon side effect of enthusiastic nerds sharing their
interests).

Eventually, I became an organiser for the
[Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney (RORO)][] meetup, and after a couple of years,
added [Elixir Sydney][], [GraphQL Sydney][], and [Elm Sydney][] to my organiser
mix (I had to pass the RORO torch on to a new team, as four meetups became a bit
too much for me to handle, and I wanted at least _some_ free time).

I think I have learned some things about running meetups and community
building. So, in the spirit of all good tech meetups, I want to share what I
have learned, and hopefully convince you to actively participate in your own
local tech communities (and maybe even start your own...?).
