In my previous post, _[Speak at a Meetup][]_, I attempted to convince you that
actively participating and delivering talks at your local technical meetup is A
Good Thing that you definitely Want To Try.

I will assume the pitch was a :sparkles: great success :sparkles:, and you have
been attending, participating, and even speaking at meetups; receiving accolades
and the admiration of your peers.

Perhaps you would like to stretch your meetup wings a bit further, give back
to your community, or even just get some event management experience. Becoming
a meetup organiser ticks all of those boxes, and so this post aims to:

- Pitch the benefits of becoming a meetup organiser
- Share some anecdotes and experiences of my time as an organiser
- Share my ideas and opinions around preparing for and holding meetups for your
  consideration

## A Word about the Plague

With the advent of [COVID-19][], meetup dynamics changed completely from
in-person to online.

As of this writing, I would certainly not feel comfortable hosting in-person
events, for the sake of all participants, even if any of the venues who have
graciously allowed us to use their facilities in the past would permit them. The
logistics of hosting an online meetup are simpler than in-person, but new
challenges arise around keeping your community coming back to events.

My hope is that in-person meetups have not become obsolete, and will return in
the near future (and hence the following information about them will become
relevant again), but even when they do, there are definitely elements from
online meetups that I intend to bring into [meatspace][], which I will further
elaborate on later.

## Meetup should exist as its own entity

## Logo

- Not required, but it would be nice to get one

## Meetup Information Source of Truth

- Github repo, not Meetup.com

## Presentation Deck

- Deckset
- Markdown in Github, README, always add PDF deck
- Get speaker photos so you can put them in slide decks, and they double as YouTube video thumbnails
  - Put speaker photo, talk name, speaker name, Twitter handle
- Welcome new people
- Ensure that date for next meetup is included in deck

## Beginner content
- Currently use Exercism
- Encourage junior developers/students to come; they are your future
- Reach out to universities, bootcamps and perhaps offer to do a talk there and promote the meetup
  - Community outreach

## Steal from other Meetups

## Canvassing Talks

- Talk pipelines are the dream
  - Be more selective about what talks go before your audience
  - Perhaps even organise talks that have a similar theme and bunch them together
- Make requests on Twitter
- Reach out directly and nudge
- If anyone puts anything in Slack or Twitter about a project they did, reach
out and offer them a spot in the speaker line up
- Offer any kind of help and assistance you can. Your job is to make your speakers look amazing on stage, real or virtual.
- Vetting speakers. Always give potential speakers the benefit of the doubt, but if you have a speaker who
  ignores meetup decorum, whether time or content, consider vetting future submissions from them

## Use of External Websites for Assets

- Meetup.com
- Github organisation/repo
- Github (issues); life-cycle of an issue
  - add templates to guide people through full-length, lightning talks, requests
  - use assignments and milestones
  - encourage sharing of materials
  - reference issue in README
  - add links to videos/slide decks as speakers share them
- Email
  - Don't use personal email: create a new one for the meetup
- Slack
- Zoom
- Twitter
  - get speakers to tweet out their materials, and re-tweet
- Dropbox
- YouTube
- Secret Information
  - 1password
  - Share information via Keybase

## In-Person Meetups

### Post Meetup
- Pub/Gelato

## Scheduling
- How long for each talk?
- Try and emphasise that speakers should time and practice their talks before delivering
- What to do if talks run long

## Food/Drink
- What is the budget?
- Pizza easiest option, but there are others
  - Corporate catering
  - Chicken wings, cold rolls
  - Take care to cater for diverse dietary options (vegetarian/vegan options)
- Do you want to be alcohol free? If not, make sure to have non-alcoholic options, even if just water.
- Where to order food/drinks and how to pay and/or get reimbursed?
- Watch out for food hogs
- Encourage people to bring food containers to prevent too much wastage

## Sponsors

## Venue

Must Haves:
- Room for 80 people to at least stand
- Projector/Big Screen
- Cables for projector/screen to laptops
- Ability for food to be delivered (street parking/elevators/docking area/trollies etc)
- Tables/[trestles][Trestle Table] where catered food can be placed
- Rubbish bins to dispose of food/cutlery/crockery
- Access to male/female toilets
- Ability for people to get in to the venue if they come late

Nice to Haves:
- Ability to provide disposable cutlery/crockery for food
- Ability to sponsor drinks/open up their drinks fridge
- Room for 80 people to sit on chairs
- Lectern
- Microphone/Sound systems
- Provide remote controls for presentations
- Ability to record presentations
- Ability to have a table to put name tags on to place
 near the entrance
- Close to CBD
- Close to public transport

## Logistics

## Online

- Zoom account
- Record meetup
- Edit talks
- Post to YouTube and promote on Twitter
- Have people on mute unless they're speaking or asking a question of the speaker at an appropriate time

## Jobs section

- Before or after the talks?

## Meetup pitch

ROROSyd is the long-running meetup group for Ruby/Ruby on Rails enthusiasts and practitioners in Sydney.
Every month we get a group together to do technical talks, usually two 15 minute talks and two 5 minute lightning talks,
and the meetup host updates the group with the Ruby-related news and events that have been happening in the community.
Ruby Australia (https://ruby.org.au/) is our governing body, and provides budget for food catering, and the event host will
usually also provide drinks, but if not, we can secure a drinks sponsor.
More information about past meetups can be found at: https://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/
We manage all our talks on our Github repo here: https://github.com/rails-oceania/roro

## Problem Solving

- Code of conduct?
- "Fit birds"

## Insurance?
- RORO insurance

## Mum's meetup

One of my favourite things about being involved in technology is the meetups.
The best ones are like school yards for adults, where friends can be made easily
cause we all know we have similar interests, and have gathered for the explicit
purpose of learning more and talking about them.

They are not structured "networking" events, where we are meant to deliberately
spend time making small talk with random people to figure out if they would help
make us money, get us a job, or generally be of use to us in the future somehow
(though that is a not uncommon side effect of enthusiastic nerds sharing their
interests).

The very evening that I moved permanently to Sydney (Australia), a place where I
had no family and few friends, I made a beeline directly for the Ruby community,
and was welcomed. Over the years, I gave talks, mentored new developers, made
new friends, and had lots of fun. Eventually, I became an organiser for the
[Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney (RORO)][] meetup, and after a couple of years,
added [Elixir Sydney][], [GraphQL Sydney][], and [Elm Sydney][] to my organiser
mix (I had to pass the RORO torch on to a new team, as four meetups became a bit
too much for me to handle, and I wanted at least _some_ free time).

I think I have learned some things about running meetups and community
building. So, in the spirit of all good tech meetups, I want to share what I
have learned, and hopefully convince you to actively participate in your own
local tech communities (and maybe even start your own...?).
