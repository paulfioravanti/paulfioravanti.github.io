  Configuring Elm for use in a Phoenix 1.3 app using Brunch.
---

Want to start using [Elm][] 0.18 on the front end of a [Phoenix][] app (in this
case, [Phoenix 1.3][])? This blog post will go over the steps I use to get
these two talking to each other.

> Looking to connect Elm to a Phoenix 1.4 app? Go and check out the update to
this blog post: [Connecting Elm to Phoenix 1.4 with webpack]

Assuming you have already [installed Phoenix 1.3][phoenix-installation], let's
kick things off with a new application.

## Generate Phoenix app

```sh
mix phx.new phoenix_with_elm
cd phoenix_with_elm
mix ecto.create
mix phx.server
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:4000/> and you should see the familiar Phoenix
welcome screen.

![Welcome to Phoenix][]{:class="img-responsive"}

No surprises here. Close down the server, and let's move on.

## Generate Elm app

First, install Elm if you haven't already:

```sh
npm install elm --global
```

Next, in order to help us generate an Elm app with a default structure and
sensible configuration, we'll use [Create Elm App][] (inspired by
[Create React App][]):

```sh
npm install create-elm-app --global
```

Generate the new Elm app inside the "front end" of the Phoenix application,
which in this case means the `assets/` directory:

```sh
cd assets
create-elm-app elm
```

You should now have an `elm` folder alongside your `js` and `css` folders.
Let's make sure it works as we expect:

```sh
cd elm
elm-app start
```

Starting the Elm app should then automatically open a browser window for you at
<http://localhost:3000/>, and you should see a message saying that...

![Your Elm app is working][]{:class="img-responsive"}

Note that the Elm app is running independently here: it knows nothing about the
Phoenix environment that it's located in, and is happily using assets,
like the image that you see, from its own `assets/elm/public/` directory.

Now that we've confirmed that both the Phoenix app and the Elm app work of their
own accord, it's time to connect them together. Close down the Elm server and
let's write some config.

## Connect Elm to Phoenix

Phoenix uses [Brunch][] out of the box as its asset build tool, so that's what
we'll use to compile the Elm code. In order to do that, we'll need
the [elm-brunch][] plugin, so let's install that and get it configured.

First, navigate back to the `assets/` folder and install elm-brunch:

```sh
npm install --save-dev elm-brunch
```

Then, open up `brunch-config.js` in a text editor and make the following
changes:

```js
exports.config = {
  // ...

  // Step 1: Add "elm" to the list of paths being watched.
  paths: {
    watched: ["static", "css", "elm", "js", "vendor"],
  },

  // Step 2: Add the elm-brunch plugin configuration.
  plugins: {
    elmBrunch: {
      elmFolder: "elm",
      mainModules: ["src/Main.elm"],
      outputFolder: "../vendor",
      outputFile: "elm.js",
      makeParameters: ["--warn"]
    },
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Note here specifically the line `outputFolder: "../vendor"`: this is to ensure
that the generated `elm.js` file gets compiled and imported before the
`js/app.js` file (it is Brunch convention that files in the `assets/vendor`
directory get compiled before code in other folders; see
[Brunch's file config documentation][] for more details).

> The `brunch-config.js` configuration does apparently allow for `before`
and `after` statements to specify that some files should be compiled before or
after others, but I have not had any luck getting them to work, so please
consider having the Elm files compiled out into the `vendor` folder a
hack/workaround for now (since code that we write in the `elm` directory does
not constitute an external library). If you have been able to use
`before`/`after` compilation order statements in a Phoenix/Elm project, please
leave a comment with a link to your config! **[Update 2018-02-16]** See the
[update][] below that puts your code back in the `js/` directory, where it
belongs:

## Display Elm app in Phoenix template

So that we show both Phoenix and Elm working together, let's keep the default
generated Phoenix layout template as-is, and replace the content of the page
index template with a `<div>` tag for the Elm app:

**`lib/phoenix_with_elm_web/templates/page/index.html.eex`**

```html
<div id="elm-main"></div>
```

Next, we'll target that `<div>` tag in the app Javascript file and get it to
replace it with the content of the Elm app, so add the following to the end
of the file:

**`assets/js/app.js`**

```js
const elmDiv = document.getElementById("elm-main");
Elm.Main.embed(elmDiv);
```

Now, run `mix phx.server` again and navigate to <http://localhost:4000> to see
if we're in business:

![Image broken][]{:class="img-responsive"}

Not quite yet, it would seem: we can see that the Elm app is being rendered in
the template, but we've got a broken image. This is because that image currently
lives inside the Elm app at `assets/elm/public/logo.svg`, and Phoenix doesn't
know anything about compilation of static image assets within Elm applications:
it's looking for assets under its own `assets/static/` directory.

The path of least resistance here is, I think, to move all assets to where
Phoenix is expecting to find them, and change the Elm code to point to them.

So, first, move the logo image into Phoenix's image assets directory:

```sh
mv assets/elm/public/logo.svg assets/static/images/logo.svg
```

Then, change the Elm code to look for the image in Phoenix (`/images/logo.svg`),
rather than in Elm (`/logo.svg`):

**`assets/elm/src/Main.elm`**

```elm
module Main exposing (..)

-- ...

view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    div []
        [ img [ src "/images/logo.svg" ] []
        , h1 [] [ text "Your Elm App is working!" ]
        ]
```

Now, at <http://localhost:4000/>, you should see the following:

![Phoenix and Elm working][]{:class="img-responsive"}

Great! You're now successfully bootstrapped to start building out your new
Phoenix-and-Elm powered app!

### Update 2018-02-16

To put the Elm-generated Javascript file into the `js` directory
(rather than in `vendor`, which should only be for third-party code), and then
have the app use it properly, edit the codebase in the following way:

**``assets/brunch-config.js``**

```js
exports.config = {
  // ...
  plugins: {
    // Specify outputFolder to be in the js/ directory, along with app.js
    elmBrunch: {
      elmFolder: "elm",
      mainModules: ["src/Main.elm"],
      outputFolder: "../js",
      outputFile: "elm.js",
      makeParameters: ["--warn"]
    },

    // Do not use ES6 compiler in vendor or Elm-generated Javascript code.
    babel: {
      ignore: [
        /vendor/,
        "js/elm.js"
      ]
    },
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Then, _specifically_ import the `Elm` variable in from `elm.js`,
now located in the same directory as `app.js`, rather than just assuming
it is available to use:

**`assets/js/app.js`**

```js
import Elm from "./elm"

const elmDiv = document.getElementById("elm-main");
Elm.Main.embed(elmDiv);
```
