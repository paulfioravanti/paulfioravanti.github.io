In a previous post, _[Speak at a Meetup][]_, I attempted to convince you that
actively participating and delivering talks at your local technical meetup is A
Good Thing that you definitely Want To Try.

I will assume the pitch was a :sparkles: great success :sparkles:, and you have
been attending, participating, and even speaking at meetups; receiving
accolades, and the admiration of your peers.

Would you consider stretching your meetup wings a bit further, give back to your
community, or even just get some event management experience?

Well, becoming a meetup organiser ticks all of those boxes! So, this post aims
to:

- Pitch the benefits of becoming a meetup organiser
- Share some anecdotes and experiences of my time as an organiser
- Share my ideas and opinions around preparing for and holding meetups, for your
  consideration
- Basically just [brain dump][] everything I know about organising meetups

There is a lot to go over, so strap yourself in.

elaborate on later.

## Why become an organiser?

![image elm-sydney-paul][]

At a distant past [Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney (RORO)][] meetup, the organisers
starting asking some participants if they would consider becoming organisers
themselves, and effectively take over running the meetup (I seem to recall
the reasons being due to the demands of raising a young family, and competing
time commitments for work, which is fair enough).

Before being asked, organising was not something I had thought about doing at
all. It was great being a participant and a member of a community, and I did not
feel actively compelled to seek out what seemed like more work. However, by the
end of the meetup, I had signed up for the following reasons:

- It would be a new experience. I had never done any kind of event organising
  before, so I decided to silence all internal dissenting voices, throw myself
  out of my comfort zone, see what would happen, and hopefully learn something
  along the way.
- Giving back would be a good thing. The very evening I moved permanently to
  Sydney, Australia, a place where I had no family and few friends, I made a
  beeline directly for the [Ruby][] community, and was welcomed. Over time,
  I gave talks, mentored new developers, made new friends, and had lots of fun.
  I felt that this was a community worth maintaining and contributing to.
- More public speaking. I figured that becoming an organiser would essentially
  force me to have a regular speaking gig, and help keep those vocal skills
  sharp.

After nearly two years of being a RORO organiser, I took on further organiser
roles at the [Elixir Sydney][], [GraphQL Sydney][], and [Elm Sydney][] meetups,
where I am still an organiser at the time of this writing. This required me
to pass on my RORO torch to a new team of amazing people, as four meetups became
a bit too much for me to handle (it is good to be cognizant of your personal
limits!).

I have no regrets on having travelled down the organiser path, and still find
that I enjoy doing it. I get tremendous personal satisfaction from being able to
provide a platform for others to speak about all the awesome stuff they have
been doing, and help them construct their talks.

Meetups are all about community, and their management teams benefit greatly from
a wide range of ideas and experiences, including yours. So, if you ever have the
opportunity to be the enabler of those sparks of enthusiasm, I would encourage
you to give it a try!

### Okay, I'm interested! Now what?

If you want to know what kinds of things you could help out with, or you want
some ideas around what to include when starting your own meetup, read on, and
hopefully the following will be of some reference as you take the reins and
start leading your community.

## Content is King

No half measures, let's start with what I consider the hardest part of
organising a technical meetup, regardless of whether it is in-person or online:
sourcing talks.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%;">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2021-01-04/graphql-schedule.jpg"
         alt="GraphQL Sydney" />

      </a>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

The dream for an organiser is to have a full pipeline of talks by willing and
able speakers on a wide variety of topics that will cover multiple months worth
of meetups. You then have the luxury of being able to group talks by content or
technology, and establish an underlying theme for a meetup.

I remember I once had a pipeline of talks that covered a present _and_ a
subsequent month's meetups, and it felt _amazing_! Good times...

So, yes, few organisers probably get to live that dream, but I am certainly not
discouraged by that. Regardless of how much I may regurgitate the benefits I
pitch in _[Speak at a Meetup][]_, I know I am making a Big Ask when I canvass
the community for presentations. I am essentially asking you to:

- take time out of your schedule to work for free by creating a talk
- take more time out of your schedule to refine and practice your talk
- maybe take even more time out of your schedule to have companion technical
  materials like demo environments and code repositories available
- do something that you may not have experience doing, and initially may be
  uncomfortable, or just not like, doing
- feel gratified that content creation is its own reward, and believe that the
  audience response will justify all your time and effort spent

Would you do that for me...? Community Glory awaits! ...Maybe next month,
then...? Well, have a think about it and let's talk again later!

...

Rinse and repeat, every month, with all the humility and thankfulness that you,
as an organiser, can muster. Take the mindset that nobody owes you anything, and
it is _the community_ doing _you_ a favour by providing the content needed to
make the meetup a success. Proactively ask, but do not pressure.

Begging is fine, though; I get to practice that a lot :pray:

### How do I find new content?

![image roro-donna][]

Finding talk content for meetups is a treasure hunt, and the ["X" that marks the
spot][X Marks the Spot] on your map is a moving target, but I have been able
to strike gold at the following places:

- **Your own meetups**. After talks are finished at every meetup, make sure to
  take some time to let participants know that you are _always_ looking for
  talks, especially from first-time speakers. After proceedings, I have had many
  people ask whether a topic they want to talk about has been done before, or
  whether it would be interesting or not. Harness that interest and curiosity
  and guide it towards becoming a talk submission.
- **Other meetups**. See a talk you liked at another meetup that your community
  might also like or benefit from? Reach out to that speaker and see if they
  want to get more mileage out of their talk with another audience. [Write once,
  run anywhere][] can work for talks, too!
- **Social Media**. Assuming your community is subscribed to your social media,
  call outs are definitely the easiest way to do a beg blast for talks. Their
  regularity can become more frequent as the date of the meetup draws closer and
  you realise you still need speakers, but it is always better to secure talks
  as early as possible.
- **Direct Messaging**. If indirect social media requests yield nothing,
  sometimes people respond to being nudged directly. You should have a list of
  your community members, so do not be shy in reaching out and getting personal
  with requests.
- **Chat channels**. Your local tech community will likely have multiple
  [Slack][] workspaces or [Discord][] servers they frequent. I have had success
  in reaching out to developers who promote their projects there to give talks
  about them (also works when those promotions happen over social media).
- **Blog posts**. Did a member of your community write a blog post about
  something interesting? Ask if they can adapt it into a talk since they have
  already gone most of the distance with regards to content creation. It's not
  plagiarism if it's your own work!
- **Coding Bootcamps**. In order to get more junior developers to attend my
  meetups, I have gone and done talks at various coding bootcamps, which are
  _very_ fertile ground for new speakers. Ask a developer-in-training to take
  a presentation/demo they have already likely delivered to their class, and
  also give it to their future peers!
- **Group Exercises**. Providing some kind of well-defined problem to solve can
  result in great content. I use [Exercism][] problems to encourage junior
  developers and first-time speakers to deliver a [lightning talk][] on their
  solution, which then often produces great community discussion about the
  different ways to figure out that particular problem.
- **Post-Meetup Pub** :beers: There is almost always a group that heads to a
  nearby pub after an in-person meetup has finished (regardless of whether you
  had alcohol available at the meetup itself). As well as affording you the
  opportunity to talk with attendees you were unable to catch up with because
  you were too busy organising, the pub environment can also be the catalyst for
  conversations that lead into getting more talk submissions (promises after a
  few drinks are still promises!). For non-drinkers, those conversations take
  place over post-meetup [gelato][] :icecream:

Once you do get someone interested in doing a talk for the meetup, depending on
their level of experience or confidence with preparing talks, you may need, or
be asked, to assist them with their content preparation, [dry runs][dry run],
timing, or generally be a [sounding board][]. Relish these requests as your
speaker's success also becomes your own (and the meetup's), and doing this often
leads to a [virtuous circle][] that then leads to even more new content.

### What if I get no content?

If, despite your best efforts, you were not able to get talks lined up for your
technical meetup, or you have had last minute talk cancellations (it happens),
and you, yourself, do not have your own content to prop up the speaker line-up,
then there are a few options that can tide you over until the next meetup (note,
though, that these ideas will probably mostly work best for in-person meetups):

- **Hack Night**. Change the meetup format to be a "hack night", where
  people can work together on solving a problem, get mentored, or assist on each
  others projects etc.
- **[Mob Programming][]**. Pick a problem to solve, like an [Exercism][]
  exercise, and have one person "drive" a machine, while everyone else chimes in
  with their solution proposals. Change the driver periodically. The rowdy
  discussions are part of the fun, and with tools like [Repl.it][], this can
  also succeed in a remote setting.
 ![image elixir-quiz][]{:
    style="width: 60%; float: right; margin: 1rem;"
  }
- **Quiz Night**. At some [Elixir Sydney][] meetups, we have used
  [Elixir Flashcards][] to form the basis of [pub quiz][]-style activities,
  where the winning team takes all...of the kudos and admiration of the
  community :clap:
- **Social Night**. Just do what you were planning on doing, but without the
  talks, focusing instead on just catching up, socialising, and debating the
  [important issues][Editor War].
- **Cancel It**. Sometimes, especially for online-only meetups, if the content
  is not there, then you may feel the need to cut your losses and focus on the
  following meetup. No shame.

There are, of course, plenty of meetups out there whose sole purpose revolves
around what I have outlined as an "alternative" activity, like hack/social
nights. You may even want to have designated events for these kinds of
activities in your meetup cadence to break up the flow, which is absolutely
fine! The most important thing is holding events that people want to keep on
coming back to, and that can be different for every community.

## Venues

If you are going to hold an in-person meetup, you need a location where people
can gather to see all the wonderful content on offer. Depending on factors like
how established your meetup is, and how many [RSVP][]s you receive, your
meetup's venue requirements will be different.

Regardless of which kind of venue you intend to host your meetup at, I would
implore you to have a think about, and explicitly make a note of, the minimum
conditions that a venue must meet in order for you to be able to run your meetup
successfully: the must-haves and the nice-to-haves.

When I attempted this exercise, this is what I came up with, and still use it as
a baseline reference (bear in mind that some of the nice-to-haves only apply to
an office venue context):

![image roro-at-reactor][]

### Must-Haves

- Room for 80 people to at least stand
- Projector/Big Screen that a laptop computer can connect to
- Ability for food options to be available or delivered
  (street parking/elevators/docking area/trollies etc)
- Tables/[trestles][Trestle Table] where food can be placed
- Ability for finished food/utensils to be cleared/disposed of
- Access to male/female toilets
- Ability for people to get in to the venue if they come late

### Nice-To-Haves

- Ability to sponsor food
- Ability to provide disposable cutlery/crockery for catered food
- Ability to sponsor drinks/open up their drinks fridge
- Room for 80 people to sit on chairs
- Lectern
- Microphone/Sound systems
- Cables for projector/screen to laptops
- Provide remote controls for presentations
- Ability to record presentations
- Ability to have a table to put name tags on to place near the entrance
- Close to the Central Business District (CBD)
- Close to public transport

The technical meetups I organise are community-driven non-profit events, where
attendance is free for participants, and so there is no monetary budget to hire
out some fancy venue. Within the context of Sydney, Australia, this has meant
a choice of two types of potential venue that meet the must-have conditions:
pubs and offices.

### Pubs

Many pubs have event rooms that they rent out, but if your meetup is held at a
time when those rooms are not typically used, you can often get room fees
waived if you ensure some minimum threshold of attendees. The assumption will
be that a high percentage of those attendees will buy food and drinks, and you,
as the organiser, can help nudge those sales along when you kick off the meetup.

I have heard that pubs are considered "neutral ground" for technical meetups,
meaning free from the "interference" of any third-party that could potentially
attempt to impose editorial control over content delivered at the meetup.

I guess that is true in theory, but I have personally never experienced a
situation where the venue is a company office and the host insists on something
like "since you're using our office we want all the speakers to be our employees
promoting our stuff".

The [RORO meetup][Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney (RORO)] had a long tradition of
being held at pubs in Sydney, but eventually moved to being held in offices, for
various reasons including issues with pub audio visual equipment and ambient
noise. See [this GitHub issue][rails-oceania/roro#81] for a stellar problem
write-up and solution proposal by [Andrew Harvey][], a previous RORO organiser.

Regardless of any shortcomings, though, a pub may be an appropriate option for
your meetup, and can provide a great casual atmosphere, without you needing to
worry about food or drink budgets since everyone takes care of themselves.

### Offices

Software developers are in the privileged position of currently being in very
high demand in the job market, which has the [knock-on effect][] of companies
being interested in hosting gatherings of developers, particularly if that
company uses the technology that your meetup focuses on.

![image roro-at-pivotal][]

In many cases, companies will also have event-related budgets enabling them to
cover food and/or drinks, and have facilities that cover a good chunk of the
nice-to-have requirements above, resulting in a great experience for your
attendees.

In return for this support, I have typically provided a spot for someone from
the company to address the audience before the meetup talks start, usually to
promote the company itself and any jobs they may have available, as well as
sponsor shout-outs at the meetup and on social media. In rare circumstances, the
host company has an employee that wants to give a community talk on home ground,
so I have been happy to add them to the speaker line-up.

The ambient noise issues that occur in pubs are generally non-existent in
offices, particularly if your meetup is in the evening, allowing everyone's
focus to stay firmly on the content you have worked so hard to procure.

Also, as opposed to pubs, who typically have a team of wait staff to clean up
after you, this is typically not the case for offices. So, make sure you
actively ask your venue contact about any post-meetup cleaning up, including
disposing of any excess food and/or putting away chairs and tables. Do not be
shy about delegating tasks like chair-stacking and cleaning-up to your audience,
either.

## Food and Drink

![image pizza][]{:
  style="width: 50%; float: right; margin-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"
}

If you can find a company who can provide you with a venue, food, and drinks
on a constant monthly (or whatever your [cadence][] is) basis, this can take a
_big load_ off your organiser shoulders, and enable you to focus exclusively on
procuring content. Build a strong relationship with these organisations and
don't let them go easily!

In the event where you need to organise some or all of the catering yourself,
though, I can recommend the following:

- Try to find another company to cover the bill. This may mean needing to pay
  the bill upfront yourself and getting reimbursed later by the sponsor. Don't
  forget to also add that company to the list of sponsors to thank at the
  meetup. If you cannot foist the bill on to another organisation, and it is
  not something you are prepared to cover yourself, I'm pretty sure it is okay
  to not provide free food and/or drinks to your attendees (online meetups don't
  send food deliveries to every attendee's residence after all...).
- Where your budget permits, try and aim for non-pizza options. Nearly every
  technical meetup with a food budget provides pizza as it's the easiest option
  (to the point where, at least in Sydney, you could probably have your dinner
  covered by tech meetups most days of the week, as long as your diet can bear
  that much pizza). However, with that same budget, you may be surprised at what
  it could get you at a corporate caterer (_COVID caveat_: who knows what the
  state of shared food like pizzas and buffet-style catering is going to be when
  in-person meetups resume, though...).
 ![image buffet][]{:
    style="float: right; margin-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"
  }
- I have had mixed results from beverage delivery services. I have found they
  have not been as timely as food delivery; as in, drinks have arrived many
  hours before times I have specified, as opposed to food, which has typically
  arrived at expected times. So, if you are getting beverages delivered, you
  probably want to make sure your venue has a fridge with spare room in it (as
  your beers will probably not arrive cold), and someone to receive the delivery
  if you cannot be there yourself. If there is a [bottle shop][] nearby to your
  venue, you are probably better off taking a team with you to buy direct and
  help bring the order back.
- Keep inclusivity in mind when ordering food and drink: include vegetarian and
  vegan options for food, and if you do have alcohol at your meetup, ensure that
  you also have non-alcoholic options (including water!).
- Watch out for food hogs that pile their plate insanely high, leaving less for
  other participants. As an organiser, sometimes you have to be an enforcer of
  decorum.
- Encourage people to bring empty food containers to your events to take home
  any leftover food, preventing wastage (_COVID caveat_: no idea if this will be
  considered a responsible idea moving forward...we will have to wait and see)

## Venue-less

If you find yourself in the middle of a plague, or you just want to free your
meetup from the constraints of geography, then you may want to consider hosting
it on that internet thing we all know and love.

![image elixir-australia][]

As of this writing, [Zoom][] is the tool _[du jour][]_ for remote meetings and
video conferences, and I have been utilising it to keep meetups active while
in-person meetups remain infeasible. However, it is not just meetup continuance
that has been achieved in the move to online-only. Significant value has been
added to meetups that I fully intend on keeping around, even after we get back
to meeting in-person again.

### Videos

Video recording talks at in-person meetups where we could access video feeds of
the speaker, slides from their computer, and, most importantly, clear audio of
the speaker's voice, seemed like an insurmountable (and expensive) task.
Capturing all of those feeds now is as trivial as pressing a button and
recording to the cloud.

There have been plenty of times in the past where I have been asked by people
who were unable to attend a meetup in-person whether the talks had been
recorded. Every time I would have to apologise and say that we were "working on"
a way to do recordings; now I just share a link to the relevant meetup
[YouTube][] channel, where I upload talks after doing some rudimentary editing
with [QuickTime][].

Being able to provide your speakers with a link to a video artefact of their
talk, and having it promoted all over social media is, no doubt, a [killer
feature][] for someone doing a talk at your meetup. It is too good to be lost
in the move back to in-person, so it will stay.

### All-Access

Regardless of how much they would like to attend your meetup in-person, there
are people who are simply unable to do so for all manner of reasons, from family
obligations to residing too far away from your venue. When your meetup has
online access, these limitations fade into irrelevance.

{: refdef: style="margin: auto; margin-bottom: 1em; width: 85%;"}
![image roro-stuck-inside][]
{: refdef}

It gives me great joy now when we say hello to new attendees, and find fellow
tech enthusiasts from all over the world have joined our "local meetup". These
days, though, "local" seems to only really apply to that nice community "feel"
of a meetup, since any open online meetup is global by default. As long as you
are awake during [AEST][]/[AEDT][] time zone evenings, you are welcome at any
online meetup that I host, no matter where you are reading this! :smiley:

So, as a meetup organiser, you have the opportunity to choose how high you would
like the fences around your meetup to be: as low as [live streaming][], or as
high as in-person venue-only. Gauge your audience, and the objectives of your
meetup, and select a strategy that works best for your community.

## Information Source of Truth

![image roro-at-ca][]

With the important high-level issues of content, venues, and nourishment taken
care of, we can now dive into the minutiae of detailed meetup topics, starting
with information management.

Each technical meetup can generate a lot of information:

- A list of talk submissions and proposals, and the back and forth
  communications that occur as they are guided towards getting slotted in to
  a meetup's talk lineup
- A final list of speakers, their talk summaries, and the materials they used
  for their talks
- Promotional and attendance sign-up pages containing information about the
  meetup, its date, time, place (real or virtual), and purpose
- Promotional social media posts
- Communication amongst organisers, and between organisers and speakers/venues
- A meetup host slide deck
- Post-meetup artefacts like videos

Unfortunately, there is no one system that takes care of handling all of this
information (that I know of). I use a variety of third party services to handle
particular types of information; you may not need them all for your meetup, but
hopefully this list will serve as some reference:

- **Email**. Create a new meetup-specific email account with a service like
  [Gmail][], store its credentials somewhere safe (like a password manager), and
  share them with any co-organisers you have via services like [Keybase][]. Use
  this email address to create accounts for all of the other third party
  services you need for the meetup, and correspond with speakers and venues with
  it (where email is needed to do that).<br />
  The benefits of doing this, rather than using your personal email, are the
  transparency and burden-sharing with your co-organisers for any external
  communications that may need to occur. Also, should the time come when you
  want to step back as an organiser and relinquish the meetup to someone else,
  having this account separate from you personally will make handover
  significantly easier. I would recommend taking the viewpoint that the meetup
  should exist as its own entity, and not be tied tightly to you, personally.
- **[Meetup.com][]**. Regardless of your opinions of this site (and some
  technical people have pretty strong opinions about it), I would say that as of
  this writing, if your audience is in the English-speaking world, and you want
  your meetup to be found on the internet, you are going to need a paid account
  here (try and get a sponsor to pay for it, if possible).<br />
  You do not need to revolve your meetup around Meetup.com. I know of some
  organisers that use it just to springboard their audience to other systems,
  like [Eventbrite][]. I only use its very basic features: discoverability via
  search, scheduling, RSVP management, and very occasionally member emails. I
  want the key information about the meetup to be separate from, and accessible
  out of, Meetup.com (in case it ever disappears or I want to change platforms),
  and so I use other services for this.
- **[GitHub][]**. As a developer you probably use GitHub (or one of its
  source-control competitors) every day and are intimately familiar with its
  workflows. I use it as the [source of truth][] for meetup information (so it
  doesn't have to be Meetup.com), and for handling the life-cycle of talk
  submissions (using [Issues][GitHub Issues]).<br />
  A meetup has its own dedicated [organisation][GitHub Organizations] and
  repository, and each individual meetup is represented by a folder in the
  repository. It contains a `README` file with meetup information (which gets
  _copied_ over to Meetup.com), as well as the host presentation materials for
  that meetup.<br />
  [Issue templates][GitHub Issue Templates] are used to guide people
  through the creation of full-length talk, lightning talk, and talk request
  submissions, and outline the general definitions and expectations of them
  (eg for this meetup, a "full-length" talk means no more than 40 minutes long
  and a "lightning talk" is typically about 5 minutes etc). Every meetup has its
  own dated GitHub milestone that issues are marked against to symbolically
  "lock in" a talk for that meetup.<br />
  Once a meetup has concluded, I encourage speakers to share their presentation
  materials publicly somewhere, then close the meetup issues, and their
  corresponding milestone. You can see examples of all this in the repositories
  for [RORO Sydney][RORO Sydney GitHub], [Elixir Sydney][Elixir Sydney GitHub],
  [GraphQL Sydney][GraphQL Sydney GitHub], or [Elm Sydney][Elm Sydney GitHub].
- **[Twitter][]**. The most widely used social media platform for technical
  people would seem to currently be Twitter. So, each of the meetups I organise
  has its own Twitter account, used for meetup and speaker promotions,
  announcements, and requests for talks. I try and aim for a promotional tweet
  with speaker and talk names at the beginning of the week the meetup is
  scheduled to occur.
- **[Dropbox][]**. Used essentially as an asset host for media contained in the
  meetup host presentation slide deck (so, not like an asset host would
  be used if images were being served on a web page that gets lots of hits).
- **[Slack][]**. There are official Slack workspaces for the programming
  languages the meetups I organise cover, and so I promote meetups in the
  `#australia` channels there, as well as in other programming community
  workspace channels where I am relatively sure it will not be seen as spam.
- **[Zoom][]**. Covered in detail above, but definitely get a paid Pro account
  if you are able to.
- **[YouTube][]**. As you may expect, a meetup's YouTube channel is the place to
  upload videos to share with and promote to the world (given the large size of
  video files, I also consider the meetup YouTube channel to be the source of
  truth for meetup videos). Make sure that your speakers know in advance that
  there is the intention of putting videos of their talk up on the meetup
  YouTube channel.<br />
  Also, be understanding of times when you may be asked to either _not_ upload a
  video, or take one down. Speakers may have let information slip out that they
  didn't mean to (or regret in hindsight), or maybe they think the talk just did
  not go well enough to want on their permanent record. Regardless of the
  reason, remove the video from the meetup channel. Meetup organisers are meant
  to spread community cheer and knowledge, not role-play as investigative
  journalists busting suspects on tape.

## Meetup Host Slide Deck

Assuming that your meetup will have at least _one_ talk, now that you
have procured your most important content, let's examine the creation and
maintenance of content that can [bookend][] it.

![image roro-rob][]

Although certainly not needed to run a successful meetup, I like to
have a meetup host slide deck to be point of reference for the event itself.

I typically include slides covering the following areas:

- Welcome participants to the meetup
- Housekeeping
- Summarise the meetup content
- Inform participants if any particular behaviour is expected of them (eg your
  meetup may have a [Code of Conduct][])
- Thank sponsors (if any)
- Introduce and hype-up the presenters and their talks (I like to have the
  presentation name, speaker name and social media handle, and a photo of the
  speaker -- all as large as possible; these slides can then double as
  video [thumbnails][thumbnail]).
- Prompt for people to submit talks for the next meetup, and provide details of
  where they should submit proposals (basically, a summarised version of the
  _[Speak at a Meetup][]_ post)
- Promote the social media accounts of the presenters and the meetup itself
- Prompt discussion of community news and events (see if you can trade meetup
  [shout-outs][shout-out] with others in your ecosystem)
- Prompt those who have jobs to promote, and those who wish to promote
  themselves for jobs, to give their pitches
- Promote any other relevant community communication media (eg chat channels
  where post-meetup conversations can continue etc)
- Inform the date and location of the next meetup

This might seem like a long list, but within the context of running the meetup,
some of these slides might only be up on screen for a matter of seconds. The
order that these slides are displayed is also up to you: for example, you may
want to have your jobs slide before the talks, so that any recruiters present
can say their piece, and then feel free to leave if they do not want to sit
through any technical content.

Ultimately, though, no one comes to a meetup for the host deck, so I have found
it best to attempt to deliver all necessary information as briskly as possible,
so that we can make way for speakers.

### Slideware

When it comes to [slideware][] used to create the host deck, I tend to optimise
for:

- [Markdown][]-based slide creation
- Ease (and correctness) of export to [PDF][] functionality

We are not creating the
[slide deck for _An Inconvenient Truth_][An_Inconvenient_Truth#The_slide_show]
here, so software like [Keynote][] or [PowerPoint][] does not feel like the
right tool for this particular job (though if you have a particular affinity to
either of these, by all means please use them; I still use them for other types
of presentations, so there is no slideware elitism here).

Being a developer, I _do_ like plain text that I can edit in a
[plain text editor][Vim]. If the deck is a simple text file, it can easily be
put under [version control][] with [Git][] to enable collaboration with others,
and then readily shared online.

I have previously used [GitPitch][] and [MDX Deck][] to do this (and they
are both good!), but my current slideware of choice is [Deckset][]. It is not
free (and currently only for Mac OS), but I have found the value I get out of it
justifies the license cost (though I do hope more themes are added in the
future...).

{: refdef}

Deckset's export to PDF functionality is great, and I find that the PDF slides
_actually_ reflect how the slides looked when viewed in the application. In my
experience, this is not always the case with other applications, which is why I
_always_ export a PDF copy of the deck and [commit][git-commit] it along with
the original Markdown file.

The PDF will always be smaller than its equivalent Keynote or Powerpoint file,
and does not really bloat the repository size. Hosting image assets used in the
slide deck outside of the repository also helps in keeping the repository size
down.

## Exception Handling

Regardless of whether you have a fantastic community with wonderful people,
as an organiser, consider giving at least give some thought to potential
worst-case scenarios that could occur at your meetup, for your community's sake.

If desired, enact some kind of formal authoritative framework, like a code of
conduct, that explicitly outlines expectations of what actions should be taken
when things go wrong, so it takes the guesswork out of what to do in undesirable
situations, enabling you to focus on just taking action.

### Audience Issues

You want speakers to not just have a great speaking experience at your meetup,
but they should feel happy to come back and deliver more content to your
community. If there are people in the audience who are disrupting a speaker,
then you are well within your rights as an organiser to caution them, or ask
them to leave.

Some speakers are very confident in their personality and speaking skills, and
sometimes even actively invite audience [heckling][heckler] for their own
amusement. Regardless of a speaker's ability to handle this, I personally
discourage it because of the negative message it sends to people in the audience
who might be considering giving a talk, but are not experienced or confident
speakers: you might be heckled and no one will stop it (leading to your
embarrassment in front of everyone).

I think that everyone should be able to feel undaunted about giving a talk to
their peers, knowing that they have the support of the room. The benefits of
a no-heckling policy far outweigh any charges of being a [killjoy][].

### Speaker Issues

It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine the quality of
someone's content in advance of a meetup unless it is actually shared with you
ahead of time (sometimes, speaker preparation can even last until the minute
they get up on stage).

In principle, I am fine with this for any new speaker, or speakers who have
successfully delivered talks before. Anyone who has willingly taken on the Big
Ask to provide content is already a hero in my eyes, and has my assumption of
[good faith][]; I am not prepared to enforce conditions like vetting all talks,
even if I had a mythical pipeline of eager speakers. Finding content is hard
enough, and the less obstacles to getting that content delivered at a meetup,
the better.

So, unless you get a request for assistance, the first time you will hear a
speaker's talk is likely to be at the meetup itself. For the meetups I organise,
this has not been an issue, aside from the very rare cases when it is.

Specifics are not relevant, and "bad" is subjective. But, ultimately, if you
think that content delivered by a speaker at a meetup you organise (or by
_anyone_ who has been given the floor to address the audience, including those
pitching jobs) has had a negative effect on your audience, could reflect badly
on you as the organiser, or your ability to get an audience to a future meetup,
then I think you are within your rights to either reject further submissions
from them, or at least insist on a dry run of any talk prior to being accepted,
where you can give feedback in the same way you would if they had actively
requested it of you. If the content delivered is just patently offensive or
inappropriate, you have no obligation to let a speaker finish their talk.

For the record, I have never had to outright reject someone's future submissions
nor eject a speaker before they finished their talk (Sydney tech communities are
really great!), but I would if the situation necessitated it.

### Edge Cases

There are some problems I have yet to encounter while organising a meetup, that
I hope I will never have to, but still occupy a slot in my list of worries.

Specifically, what if someone chokes on food provided at the meetup, or slips
on something and falls, and an ambulance has to be called? Or, what if someone
drinks too much and decides to get violent with people or property, and police
have to be called? Is anyone liable in this situation? If so, who? The venue?
Me, personally? Does the meetup itself have coverage under the venue's insurance
policy? I am sure that the answer to this can vary drastically by jurisdiction
and country, but I am wondering if there are any general rules of thumb to
follow here, or maybe if I am worrying too much.

If you are knowledgeable about these kinds of things, please reach out to me
privately or share your experience or expertise in a comment. It would be great
to learn more about this while in-person meetups are on hiatus.

## Succession Planning

![image roro-mat-gael][]{:
  style="width: 50%; float: right; margin-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"
}

Engagement with any kind of work, like any good story, will have a beginning,
middle, and end. Organising a meetup is no different: there will come a time
where you will need to step back and divest yourself of organisational
involvement in your meetup.

Assuming that your meetup has been created as its own entity, and is more than a
[cult of personality][] of your own making, you will likely _want_ the meetup to
outlast your involvement in it, if for no other reason than to continue your
involvement as just another attendee.

I think that the best ways to ensure a smooth transition of responsibility is
to have:

- **Co-organisers**. The higher your [bus factor][], the easier handover will
  be (and the ability to take holidays!). There is probably an upper limit
  that, if exceeded, results in a [too many chefs][]-style situation, but I have
  not hit that yet. Having said that, the biggest meetup organisational team I
  have worked on has been three people, which has been a fine number.
- **Long Goodbyes**. If you manage to recruit another organiser because you plan
  to step down, try not to hand them the keys to the meetup, wish them the best
  for the next one, and then disappear. I would recommend having them [shadow][]
  you for a meetup or two, then take an organiser back seat for the next one or
  two as your successor takes the lead, and _then_ fade away into the night.

## Conclusion

I think you now know everything that I do about organising meetups, save for
perhaps some intuitive on-the-fly problem solving skills you naturally develop
after having actually organised and run a few meetups (and are impossible for me
to enumerate coherently in this post).

I hope you are able to contribute to creating the kinds of communities you would
like to see exist and thrive.

My thanks go out to you for reading this all the way to the end, and also to
all the previous and current organisers of meetups I am currently involved with,
or have been previously involved with, whose shoulders I stand on:

- [Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney (RORO)][]
- [Elixir Sydney][]
- [GraphQL Sydney][]
- [Elm Sydney][]

Thanks also go to the organisers of other particular meetups I attend, and have
been inspired by, or flagrantly stolen ideas from (no surprises that they are
also web development-focused groups):

- [SydCSS][]
- [SydJS][]
- [React Sydney][]

There are so many differing opinions about the ways to run meetups, that I have
no doubt that there are ways I can improve the way I run mine. So, if you have
any feedback, suggestions, or ideas, by all means please leave a comment or
reach out to me directly.
