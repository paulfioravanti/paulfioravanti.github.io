  During Japan's mobile web infancy, I wanted my little community newsletter to

Back in the early 2000s, when I was on the [JET Programme][] in
[Kochi Prefecture][], I was in charge of an English/Japanese bilingual community
newsletter called _Oi! Kochi_ (オーイ！<ruby>高知<rt>こうち</rt></ruby>).

<div style="display: block; text-align: center;">
  <figure style="float: right; display: inline-block; margin: 1em; width: 60%;">
    <img src="/assets/images/2021-01-03/oi-kochi-md.jpg"
         alt="Oi! Kochi Minidisc" />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
      I made sure to use only the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniDisc">latest technology</a>
      when recording interviews.

</div>

Since my position was [Coordinator of International Relations][], my mere
involvement with the newsletter automatically fulfilled its "international
relations" objective, giving me pretty much free reign over what content
appeared in it.

I did not fancy myself as a journalist at all, and had no idea what I was doing
(my lack of logo design skills may have clued you in on that, not that current
me would be able to do any better...; for those curious, yes, that is [Sakamoto
Ryōma][] on the left), but it was great fun being able to _act_ as a reporter,
editor, and translator to produce this thing that was being read by others.

After the third issue I had been involved with was released, I was informed
that due to departmental budget cuts, _Oi! Kochi_ no longer had a print budget,
and hence it would be the final issue.

Not wanting my run to end so soon, I thought that this might be a good
opportunity to attempt to put _Oi! Kochi_ not just on the web, but attempt to
give it a space within the [walled garden][] that was Japan's fledgling mobile
internet.

<div style="display: block; text-align: center;">
  <figure style="float: left; display: inline-block; margin: 0;
                 margin-right: 1em; width: 50%;">
    <img src="/assets/images/2021-01-03/Softbank911sh-01.jpg"
         alt="A Softbank911sh-01 feature phone." />

</div>

So, without knowing anything about code whatsoever, I attempted to make some
[HTML][] web pages. Japan was predominantly using clamshell-style [feature
phones][], and sites developed for them used [C-HTML][], so that is what I used
for the mobile pages.

I recall having eventually put the pages _somewhere_ on the internet, but I do
not think the Kochi Prefectural Government gave me any space on their servers
(not that I understood what a server was back then...), but probably used some
kind of free service and shared the link with whomever would humour me. Those
pages are, unsurprisingly, long gone.

However, I did still have the codebases lying around, and figured it would be
nice to see if they could be deployed back out on the internet, so the content
does not stay lost. So, here they are!

- [Oi! Kochi Web Pages][]
- [Oi! Kochi Mobile Pages][]

Revel in their [Web 1.0][]-ness!

I have also made the codebases, and scans of the print versions of the
newsletter, available in the [Oi! Kochi GitHub repository][]. If you have the
courage to actually look at the code, remember, it was written a long time
ago...

## Viewing Pages

<div style="display: block; text-align: center;">
  <figure style="float: right; display: inline-block; margin: 1em; width: 40%;">
    <img src="/assets/images/2021-01-03/paul-on-feature-phone.jpg"
         alt="Paul on a feature phone" />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
      A younger me on a feature phone, with mandatory extra-long straps, which
      was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6Dc7W6jXCo">the style at the
      time</a>.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

For the most period-accurate browsing experience (simulating how the pages
would have looked on my [AU by KDDI][] phone), I would have recommended using
an emulator that replicates the old Japanese feature phones, the closest of
which I've ever found is viewing the pages using the [Firefox][] browser, along
with the [FireMobileSimulator][] add-on.

Unfortunately, FireMobileSimulator is now dead and buried, with no future
releases planned, and it does not work on current versions of Firefox. There are
also no alternatives that I could find.

The only consolation is that you are able to trigger [`accesskey` attributes][]
for links (ie for a link with text "**1. English**", you could press the :one:
number key on the feature phone to directly "click" on that link) in Firefox and
Chrome.  See [Mozilla's `accesskey` page][] for the key shortcuts for your
platform and browser.
