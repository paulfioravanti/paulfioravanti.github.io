  Level N1 of The Japanese Language Proficiency Test is a tough nut to crack,
  but these study methods got me over the line.
---

In my life, I have failed the highest level of the [Japanese Language
Proficiency Test][] (JLPT) 7 times.

Five of my attempts on the [old Level 1 exam][JLPT Previous Format] (before it
became [N1][JLPT Level Summary]) were when I was living and working in
Japan, using Japanese full-time. I felt like my abilities were improving, so
every <ruby>不合格<rt>ふごうかく</rt></ruby> (Failure) notification stung a
little harder than the last, but, well...maybe I would pass it the following
year.

As the time came for me to move out of Japan, I wanted to pass the JLPT _just
once_ to get a certificate. So, I cut my losses, attempted the old Level 2 exam,
passed it, and appeased myself with the relief that I would finally be free of
these infernal tests.

Fast forward 8 years.

For whatever reason, I started to get antsy about leaving my JLPT attempt in a
failed state for so long: it beat me, and that sucked, and _I_ sucked, and I was
obviously not over it.

But before making another attempt, though, I had to figure out what went wrong,
why I had continued to fail all those other times, re-strategise my study plans,
and actually execute them: _properly_, this time.

Here is what got me over the line.

> The following contains to my personal opinions and experiences with the N1
exam specifically: nothing is meant to be prescriptive (since everyone learns
differently), and the approaches may not be relevant for all levels of the JLPT.
My hope is that you will find at least something of reference as you formulate
your own study plan.

## Mindset Change

There were years where I attempted to study for the JLPT, and others where I
would promptly forget I applied to take it, turn up on the day, and test my
luck.

Neither scenario resulted in significantly different scores, though, so it would
seem that the net value of any dedicated study I did, and any general
improvements in the language gained during the year, was zero.

Therein lies the need for the mindset change: **JLPT N1 does not test your
Japanese abilities so much as it tests your ability to pass JLPT N1**.

The exam demands that:

- you remember a lot of grammar patterns, _[kanji][]_, and vocabulary that are
  used infrequently in everyday Japanese
- you speed-read excerpts from novels and articles and be able to interpret and
  answer nuanced questions about them
- you keep a mental track of the results of multiple weaving threads of
  conversations (which feel like they are deliberately engineered to trick you)
  before finding out which one is related to the question

It is a high-stress artificial environment requiring deep focus, where there
is no time to waste when considering questions: you have to instinctively know
answers _immediately_, or take your best guess and move on. This is not Japanese
in a real life context.

Naturally-assimilated Japanese abilities will not cut it here: your brain
needs to go to the gym to build muscle memory through memorisation drilling
exercises. The weights (content) that you train on are determined by the
barbells (books) that you use, and N1 barbells are not lightweight.

## Buy Textbooks

A cursory search on any internet book seller's site for
"<ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</rt>能力<rt>のうりょく</rt>試験<rt>しけん</rt></ruby>"
yields more options than you could possibly read through, and a further search
querying which set of books are "the best" will likely net you enough opinions
to cause [analysis paralysis][].

I cannot help decide which textbooks would be right for you, but what I can say
is that I used the following books in order to get a passing grade for N1 (and
can personally recommend them):

- The [<ruby>新完全<rt>しんかんぜん</rt></ruby>マスター][] (_Shin Kanzen
  Master_) series of books. There is five in the set: one each for grammar
  (<ruby>文法<rt>ぶんぽう</rt></ruby>), reading comprehension
  (<ruby>読解<rt>どっかい</rt></ruby>), _kanji_
  (<ruby>漢字<rt>かんじ</rt></ruby>), vocabulary
  (<ruby>語彙<rt>ごい</rt></ruby>), and listening comprehension
  (<ruby>聴解<rt>ちょうかい</rt></ruby>). Get them all.
- The [<ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</rt>能力<rt>のうりょく</rt>試験<rt>しけん</rt>公式<rt>こうしき</rt>問題集<rt>もんだいしゅう</rt></ruby>][]
  (JLPT Official Practice Workbook). This book contains practice exams that you
  will absolutely want to attempt, under exam conditions, about 1-2 weeks before
  the actual exam. It's all well and good to study in a vacuum, but you will
  not want exam day to be the first time you realise you have budgeted your
  efforts incorrectly and need to cover too much ground in too little time. Do
  all of the practice exams.

The links above lead to Japan-based book stores which may or may not ship
overseas. If you have issues ordering the books, or you do not want to wait
for shipping, then definitely check out your local international book store.

If you are in Australia, I recommend checking out [Kinokuniya][]'s [range of
JLPT books][Kinokuniya JLPT books], and visiting them if you are in range of
a store.

## Strict Study Cadence

Are you serious about getting N1? Great, because you are going to need to
_deliberately_ and _consciously_ set aside time to study _every day_ for at
least a few months. There will inevitably be times where you are tired or you
may just not want to study.

Too bad. Do it. Even if you slightly reduce your study time on off-days, you
_must_ keep up your cadence because it is so easy to break, and stay broken.

You are going to run a marathon that is currently only held twice a year, and
the price of failure is the time, effort, and cost of having to ramp up for the
exam _again_, not to mention the opportunity cost of not being able to direct
those efforts to some other activity/hobby/venture you may have.

For me, I took an [Eat That Frog][] approach and front-loaded my Japanese study
early in the morning, every morning, during my study marathon period.

So, what is the optimal amount of study time per day? I actually do not know,
so I outsourced figuring that out to a software program specifically designed
to help you remember things efficiently.

## Textbooks -> Flash Cards

[Anki][] was the secret weapon to my success at passing JLPT N1.

{: refdef: style="margin: auto; width: 85%;"}
![Anki Kanji Back Template][]
{: refdef}

Those textbooks you bought? The content in them is great, but in the confines
of those dead trees, none of it is:

- searchable
- portable
- customisable
- extensible

Therefore, the very first activity in your study plan should be to manually port
_all_ the content in those books into a different format: Anki flash cards.

Yes, [AnkiWeb][] has a huge set of [community-submitted JLPT-related flash card
decks][AnkiWeb JLPT] that you can download and use for free. But, I _strongly_
recommend not using any of them, and instead **roll your own decks as this is
a great form of study**. It will markedly assist in:

- your initial learning and internalising of the content
- your revision of the content as Anki works its spaced-revision-ing algorithms
  over it, surfacing your weaknesses and making sure they improve

For me, the most logical candidates for books to port over to Anki flash cards
ended up being grammar (103 cards), _kanji_ (394 cards), and vocabulary (239
cards).

After creating the three decks, I would revise each of them every day at the
pace that Anki dictated, and slot in listening and reading comprehension study
once Anki preventing me from revising the decks further.

During commutes to work, I would continue to revise the cards using
[AnkiMobile][].  You may think that AnkiMobile is pricey for "just an app", but,
in my opinion, it is absolutely worth it given the objective you are trying to
achieve, and the price of failure. I highly recommended using it if you can, and
you can feel good about helping to support keeping Anki itself free.

Creating the actual flash card decks can be a bit confusing, especially if you
do not have a coding background, so I have shared
[my JLPT Anki templates][paulfioravanti/jlpt], which you are free to use to
create your own cards and/or customise to your liking. Each deck has an example
card to get your started.

I have deliberately not shared my own decks on AnkiWeb, or anywhere else, as
they are a straight port of copyrighted content. It would not be fair to the
book authors, and I am sure their publishers would not be so happy with me if I
did. So, definitely roll your own decks.

## Results

I rinsed and repeated the Anki revision process for a few months, kicked off
practice exams a couple of weeks before the day of the JLPT, and eventually
entered the exam with a feeling of contentedness knowing that I did all I could
possibly have done.

The exam was still really tough, and I left it giving myself a 50-50 chance of
passing, since the brutal time limitations still left me having to rush through
some sections and guess at some problems.

But on that attempt, on attempt number eight, I finally got it. So, with
apologies to [Vitas Gerulaitis][]:

> And let that be a lesson to you all. No JLPT exam beats Paul Fioravanti 8
times in a row.

## Worth it?

In order to relieve my poor shoulder of the giant JLPT-shaped chip that had
obviously been laying dormant there for years, the effort put in to finally
getting that passing mark was absolutely worth it.

From a career perspective, not having Level 1 (or any level) ever stopped me
from getting a job while I was living in Japan. I found that most
employment-based language "testing" ended up being litmus tests during
face-to-face interviews to see if you had any degree of conversational and
_kanji_-reading fluency.

I guess that if you are planning on doing [an activity where passing JLPT N1 is
a pre-requisite][JLPT Acceptance in Japan], then passing it represents a hard
barrier that you must cross. But, back in Australia, my work requires no
Japanese at all, so the JLPT qualification is simply a nice feather in my hat,
and something I can write a blog post about.

From a language perspective, I absolutely did learn a lot of interesting new
words, grammar, and _kanji_. There may be a lot of content examined in the JLPT
that is not used much in everyday Japanese, but learning it _was_ valuable.
From that point of view, you could say that studying for the JLPT forced my hand
in learning Japanese I would not have picked up of my own volition, for which I
am thankful.

## Postscript: After N1

I do not study Japanese formally any more, but I do keep up my language practice
every day, so here is a random list of the forms that that takes.

- I have a Japanese spouse, and my spoken language at home is Japanese. I'm not
  saying you should marry a Japanese to keep up your language skills, of course,
  but the fact is, it does help a lot.
- [Yahoo Japan News][], regardless of its design being stuck in [Web 1.0][], is
  still the most trafficked news site in Japan, and so is worth checking
  regularly on that merit alone. If you use [Google Chrome][], I _highly_
  recommend installing the [rikaikun][] extension to help make reading _kanji_ a
  breeze.
- I do not watch much Japanese TV, but one show that I will actively watch every
  week is [ワイドナショー][] (The Wide Show), a news and entertainment show.
  I like [Hitoshi Matsumoto][], a comedian and one of the co-hosts, and I find
  that the programme is good to help get a view on what stories and issues are
  being talked about in Japan currently. There is no official way to view the
  show outside of Japan, but you can always find a channel on YouTube that
  streams it live at 10:00am [JST][] Sundays.
- There are a lot of great YouTube channels originating from Japan. Here is a
  selection of a few in my subscriptions:
  - [<ruby>日本語<rt>にほんご</rt></ruby>の<ruby>森<rt>もり</rt></ruby>][]:
    _Nihongo no Mori_, the Japanese Forest, is a fantastic resource for JLPT
    videos. If you are actively studying, or you just want the occasional
    refresher, you want to subscribe to this channel.
  - [エガちゃんねる EGA-CHANNEL][]: The official channel of [Egashira 2:50][],
    probably the nicest completely bonkers comedian in Japan.
  - [マキシマム ザ ホルモン<ruby>公式<rt>こうしき</rt></ruby>][]: The official
    channel of band [Maximum the Hormone][]. Their music is awesome, but in
    particular, their ガチンコ ザ ホルモン series where they held auditions to
    create a second "outlet" of their band
    (２<ruby>号店<rt>ごうてん</rt></ruby>) is novel and excellent viewing.
  - [<ruby>禁断<rt>きんだん</rt></ruby>ボーイズ][]: The channel for Kindan
    (Prohibited) Boys. The interviews this team of 4 comedians do in places like
    [Shibuya][] provide a great insight into the minds of young Japanese. The
    "Cinderella" dating show they did for one of their members, "Messiah"
    (めさいあシンデレラ), is one of the channel highlights.
  - Popular YouTubers [ヒカル（Hikaru）][] and [ラファエル Raphael][] have some
    interesting content in their channels, and I would recommend sorting by
    "Most popular" to see if what they offer is of interest to you.
