  Past-Me wrote stuff down that benefited Future-Me.<br />
  Present-Me needs to keep paying that forward.

After joining my last [Ruby on Rails][] project as a software developer, I
wanted to see if I could quickly deliver some easy wins before starting any more
difficult work. So, I decided to give my client's web application a "technical
audit".

I had done this kind of thing before on other Rails projects, but that had been
many years ago, and I can barely remember what I coded last week, let alone all
the steps on some checklist I wrote in the ancient past.

Luckily, Past-Me apparently had the enormous foresight to write up all the
steps he thought of in a post on a previous employer's blog:
_[Profile Your Future App][]_.

Some of the content is a bit outdated as of this writing, particularly with
regards to some of the external services it references (which is to be expected,
as tech never stands still), but I was able to leverage a good deal of post's
content to improve the quality of the application I was working on without
having to [reinvent the wheel][] (and maybe some other web developer might,
too).

So, thanks Past-Me, ya did good! As you figured stuff out, you wrote it down,
and it paid future dividends: a beneficial and repeatable process that anyone
can do for themselves.

That's it. That's the lesson. [Thanks for coming to my TED blog post][Thanks For
Coming To My TED Talk].

Now you, the guy writing this sentence: you reckon you can take your own advice
and keep this up?

## Happy 50th Postiversary

It has only taken nearly 5 years of writing, at the cracking speed of less than
one post per month, but you are reading this blog's 50th post. In muted
celebration of this modest achievement, I thought I'd mark the occasion with a
[retrospective][].

The initial reasons I had to attempt to kick-start a blog (after [failing
once before][Hello, Blog!]) were:

- Using it as a knowledge repository: get stuff out of my head and
  [persisted][Persistence] somewhere else, so I could "confidently forget" it
  until (maybe) Future-Me needs it
- The intrinsic value of being able to share knowledge with others, in hopes
  that they, too, can benefit from it
- Get better at technical writing, and writing English in general
- Directly receive reputation-building [SEO][] "[link juice][]" for stuff I
  write, rather than just give it away for free to other third-party sites

How did all of that go? Below are the results of my _[Omphaloskepsis][]_ Report,
though the [TL;DR][] could be summed up with this tweet:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 60%">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

## What was Done Well

### Catalyst for Learning

Writing about certain topics forced me to attempt to _really_ learn about them
in detail. No self-imposed deadlines meant I would often happily absail down
every rabbit hole I encountered, and attempt to be as thorough as possible in
surfacing information for posts. If I was going to write about a topic, I would
usually intend for it to be [one and done][].


- Actually getting to 50 posts
- Building a pipeline of ideas, and remembering to add ideas to it the moment I
  think of them
- Enabling "confident forgetting"
- Writing stuff down, and attempting to cover all bases, means you have to
  really spend the time to research and learn your topic, and then hopefully
  mold it into a coherent story
- Decent SEO on posts that cover niche or specialised subjects
- Finding my current blog voice
- Becoming a better writer
- Being able to reference my own work later when working on similar topics as a
  post covers, long after having written the post
- Blog customisations (mailing list, custom template code)
- Learned a lot about Jekyll and blog themes
- Guest posts (ZSA)

## What could be Done Better

- Proper cadence
- Giving posts enough time to breath
- Build a pipeline of posts if I get a period of extended focus/flow
- Audio narration
- Promoting existence of mailing list. Currently too subtle...?
- Being more shameless in promoting posts earlier
- Promoting posts in more places (Slack/Discord communities? Reddit? LinkedIn
  groups? Hacker News?)
- Blog uses a theme. Even though there are some customisations, it looks like
  all the rest of the blogs that use Minimal Mistakes
- Blog more on current trends or blog more about topics that I get high SEO on?
- Monetise?

## Actions for Improvement

- Establish a regular blogging habit, not just pick-up/put-down
- Why continue?
