  I hate running, but I do it anyway.

Coming back home from picking up dinner, I arrived at my front door out of
breath, heart beating rapidly, and just generally feeling unpleasant.

The cause: exerting the apparently gargantuan effort of climbing up a couple of
flights of stairs.

In early 2020, we were just finding out about a [virus][COVID-19] that
would seem to cause respiratory illness, which, if we are not careful, we may
contract in the short term, but will most definitely come into contact with in
the long term.

My lack of stamina and general fitness made me worried that I was not in any
kind of state to potentially take on a fight for my life, should I become
infected[^1].

"Running helps improve endurance, doesn't it?", I thought. "It's really boring,
but I guess I should give it a try." So, I did.

## Body Compilation

While everyone understands intuitively how to logistically make your body
perform the act of running (walking, but faster, right?), when your initial
fitness [state][] is the equivalent of an unmaintained
[:beetle:-riddled][Software bug] [:spaghetti: codebase][], some [refactoring][]
work will be needed before you can get yourself to [run][] properly.

If you are just starting to run, what distance should you aim for? Should you
be running a certain amount of time per day? A certain number of times per week?
How fast should you be attempting to run? Do you have to start by running? What
about jogging, or just walking?

I had no answers to these questions. I did not want to end up being paralysed
into doing nothing, but also did not want to overexert myself into injury or
inability to continue longer term.

So, I did the laziest thing possible: outsourced building of a running strategy
to the well-known [Couch to 5K][] (C25K) plan.

Since it is just a plan, there are many different technical implementations of
it, from the official [iOS][C25K Official iOS] and
[Android][C25K Official Android] apps, to
[the Active-branded iOS app][C25K Active iOS] I somehow ended up using (I'd
wager C25K apps are pretty much interchangeable).

With canned plan in hand, only the most difficult step remained: execution. I
had to actually force myself to do this thing over the course of 9 weeks.

I was self-conscious about jogging during daylight hours, so I decided to make
things even more difficult for myself by going out at the
social-distancing-friendly time of 5:00am, three times a week, and do whatever
the app robot voice told me to do: "walk", "brisk walk", or "jog" at varying
intervals.

The only thing that made this even slightly bearable was listening to
spoken-word [podcasts][]. They enabled my brain to be distracted by focusing on
stories and conversations, while my body and breathing went on auto-pilot to
push me through each day of the programme.

Although the podcasts helped, sticking to this routine, especially as 5:00am got
colder and darker heading into winter, was an exercise in grit. Every fibre of
my being questioned the need to do this to myself, but I found that as long as I
could actually pull myself out of bed, that would be enough momentum to get me
out the door.

Sometimes, I did lose the battle with my wake-up alarm, necessitating catch up
sessions on concurrent days if I was going to stick to C25K's schedule.
Sometimes, the battle got lost for me, as I pulled both of my calf muscles
during the course of the C25K, resulting in me limping home, and needing to rest
for a few days.

      of how severe your symptoms end up being.
