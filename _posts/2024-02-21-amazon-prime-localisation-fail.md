  Does Prime have an unconscious bias hard coded in its media descriptions?
---

During my last trip to Japan, I watched my Japanese sister-in-law flick through
her [Amazon Prime][] account, looking for something to watch.

When she opened the page for [THE LEGEND & BUTTERFLY][], I commented that it
looks like Amazon has a localisation problem:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2024-02-21/legend-and-butterfly-jp.jpg"
         alt="THE LEGEND & BUTTERFLY Japanese page on Amazon Prime">
  </figure>
</div>

She looked puzzled and was not sure what I meant. If you are a Japanese speaker,
can you see something that does not seem quite right?

Let's see the English version as well, because it has the same problem:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2024-02-21/legend-and-butterfly-en.jpg"
         alt="THE LEGEND & BUTTERFLY English page on Amazon Prime">
  </figure>
</div>

The context here is that we are physically in Japan, using Amazon Prime's
Japanese site, to view information about a Japanese-language movie that was made
in Japan, with a Japanese cast...

...And yet, the film is tagged as being "International" (or, more blatantly, a
"foreign film", as per "外国映画", the Japanese translation of the tag).

No, Amazon, it is not an international film. From where we were sitting, it is
about as local as you can get.

So, what is Amazon's definition of "international" media? I am wagering you can
already guess, but let's go through the motions and do some searching anyway,
for science!

Let's start in the immediate area from Japan with Korean drama [Death's Game][]:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2024-02-21/deaths-game-en.jpg"
         alt="Death's Game English page on Amazon Prime">
  </figure>
</div>

Looks like we are still in international waters. Let's assume that Asia is out,
and head to Europe: is Italian comedy series [LOL: Chi ride è fuori][]
international?

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2024-02-21/chi-ride-e-fuori-en.jpg"
         alt="LOL: Chi ride è fuori English page on Amazon Prime">
  </figure>
</div>

Sure is. Maybe Amazon thinks "international" means "language"...? Let's try some
English only titles. What does it say about long running Australian soap opera
[Neighbours][]?

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">

    <img src="/assets/images/2024-02-21/neighbours-en.jpg"
         alt="Neighbours English page on Amazon Prime">
  </figure>
</div>

Hmm...well, I guess Aussies can be hard to understand with our strange accents.
Maybe Amazon means some English accents are international, and some not...?
How about something from the United Kingdom, birthplace of English and home of
[Received Pronunciation][]? Let's look at [Father Brown][]:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">

</div>

\*Gasp\*! A show using the most English of Englishes is _still_ considered to be
"international"? How can this be...?

To the surprise of no one, I am sure, no media on Amazon Prime originating from
the United States (at least that I have been able to find) is tagged as being
"international". This can be seen as a codification of Amazon's identity as a
US company: everything from the United States is "local" and everything from
outside the United States is "international". Amazon may currently operate on a
global scale, but true to its origins, it still seems to keep that US-centric
viewpoint, and that is reflected in its systems.

This is not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself. I think the issue is when
you do this yet also [tout your own localisation efforts publicly][Variety
article]:

> "When we think about launching in a new country, we really want to make sure

I would posit that the Prime interface can probably do a bit better on the
"truly local feel" aspect. To be fair, though, I did find titles from non-US
countries on Amazon Prime that are _not_ specifically tagged with
"International", but there is no way to know whether its absence is intentional,
and indicative of some active effort to change.

Regardless, I think the solutions are to either:

- just remove the "International" tag altogether, because from a global
  standpoint, it is meaningless. I am sure that in the metadata of each piece of
  media is its "country of origin" and "spoken language", and that is probably
  enough to cover "show me something foreign/different" use cases that viewers
  may have
- if it must still exist, have the "International" tag become a kind of virtual
  tag. Rather than be tied directly to media, relate it to a user and their
  location/language preferences etc, and only display it when they view content
  that is different to those preferences

This whole post may be about making a mountain out of a tag-shaped molehill that
it seems most people do not notice or care about. But, it goes to show that
internationalisation/localisation is hard, and even for huge companies with
lots of resources like Amazon, there is always room for improvement.
