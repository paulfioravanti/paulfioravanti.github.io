  Level N1 of The Japanese Language Proficiency Test is a tough nut to crack,
  but these study methods got me over the line.
---

In my life, I have failed the highest level of the [Japanese Language
Proficiency Test][] (JLPT) 7 times.

Five of my attempts on the [old Level 1 exam][JLPT Previous Format] (before it
became [N1][JLPT Level Summary]) were when I was living and working in
Japan, using Japanese full-time. I felt like my abilities were improving, so
every 不合格 (Failure) notification stung a little harder than the last, but,
well...maybe I would pass it the following year.

As the time came for me to move out of Japan, I wanted to pass the JLPT _just
once_ to get a certificate. So, I cut my losses, attempted the old Level 2 exam,
passed it, and appeased myself with the relief that I would finally be free of
exams.

Fast forward 8 years.

For whatever reason, I started to get antsy about leaving my JLPT attempt in a
failed state for so long: it beat me, and that sucked, and _I_ sucked, and I was
obviously not over it.

But before making another attempt, though, I had to figure out what went wrong,
why I had continued to fail all those other times, re-strategise my study plans,
and actually execute them: _properly_, this time.

Here is what got me over the line.

> The following contains to my personal opinions and experiences with the N1
exam specifically: nothing is meant to be prescriptive (since everyone learns
differently), and all the strategies may not be relevant for all levels of the
JLPT.  So, pick and choose (or completely dismiss) any (or all) of the points
below.

## Mindset Change

The JLPT was held once a year during my run of failure (twice a year as of this
writing). There were years where I attempted to study before the exam, and
others where I would promptly forget I applied to take it, turn up on the day,
and test my luck.

Neither scenario resulted in significantly different scores, so it would seem
that the net value of any dedicated study I did, and any general improvements in
the language gained during the year, was zero.

Therein lies the need for the mindset change: **JLPT N1 does not test your
Japanese abilities so much as it tests your ability to pass JLPT N1**.

The exam demands that:

- you remember a lot of grammar patterns, _[kanji][]_, and vocabulary that are
  used infrequently in everyday Japanese
- you speed-read excerpts from novels and articles and be able to interpret and
  answer nuanced questions about them
- you keep a mental track of the results of multiple weaving threads of
  conversations (which feel like they are deliberately engineered to trick you)
  before finding out which one is related to the question

It is a high-stress artificial environment requiring deep focus, where there
is no time to waste when considering questions: you have to instinctively know
answers _immediately_, or take your best guess and move on.

Naturally-assimilated Japanese abilities will not cut it here: your brain
needs to go to the gym to build muscle memory through memorisation drilling
exercises. The weights (content) that you train on are determined by the
barbells (books) that you use, and N1 barbells are not light.
