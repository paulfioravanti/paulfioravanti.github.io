  Level N1 of The Japanese Language Proficiency Test is a tough nut to crack,
  but these study methods got me over the line.
---

In my life, I have failed the highest level of Japanese Language Proficiency
Test (JLPT) 7 times.

Reading that sentence back to myself is quite embarrassing. Seven. ファッキング.
Times.

Five of my attempts on the old Level 1 exam (before it became N1) were when I
was actually living and working in Japan. I was using Japanese on a full-time
daily basis, and I felt like it was improving, so every 不合格 (Failure)
notification stung a little harder than the last.

Eventually, I cut my losses, attempted the old Level 2 exam, passed it, and just
resigned myself to be content with that. I was leaving Japan at that time, so I
thought I would probably have no more need of any formal Japanese language
qualifications, anyway.

Fast forward 8 years.

I was right about not needing Japanese in a professional capacity, but for
whatever reason, I started to get antsy about leaving that exam in a failed
state for so long: it beat me, and that sucked, and I was obviously not over it,
so I resolved to try again.

But before making another attempt, I had to figure out what went wrong, why I
had continued to fail all those other times, re-strategise my study plans, and
execute them.

But, looking back, those failures were indicative of the amount of effort, or
lack thereof, that I put in to dedicated study of Japanese _specifically for the
purpose of passing the JLPT_.
