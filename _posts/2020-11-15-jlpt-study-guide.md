  Level N1 of The Japanese Language Proficiency Test is a tough nut to crack,
  but these study methods got me over the line.
---

In my life, I have failed the highest level of Japanese Language Proficiency
Test (JLPT) 7 times.

Reading that sentence back to myself is quite embarrassing.

Five of my attempts on the old Level 1 exam (before it became N1) were when I
was living and working in Japan, using Japanese full-time. I felt like my
abilities were improving, so every 不合格 (Failure) notification stung a little
harder than the last, but, well...maybe I would pass it the following year.

As the time came for me to leave Japan, I wanted to pass the JLPT _just_ once
to get a certificate. So, I cut my losses, attempted the old Level 2 exam,
passed it, and appeased myself with the relief that I would finally be free of
exams.

Fast forward 8 years.

For whatever reason, I started to get antsy about leaving my JLPT attempt in a
failed state for so long: it beat me, and that sucked, and _I_ sucked, and I was
obviously not over it.

But before making another attempt, though, I had to figure out what went wrong,
why I had continued to fail all those other times (aside from stubbornness),
re-strategise my study plans, and actually execute them, properly this time.

Here is what got me over the line.

## Mindset Change

## Establish a Strict Study Cadence

## Buy Textbooks

## Adapt Textbooks to Flash Cards

## Surrender to Anki

## Practice Exams

But, looking back, those failures were indicative of the amount of effort, or
lack thereof, that I put in to dedicated study of Japanese _specifically for the
purpose of passing the JLPT_.
