  Meetups are a great way to enrich your technical journey outside of your
  daily endeavours. You may even want to start your own. So, here's a set of
  tips I wish I had when I first started organising.
---

One of my favourite things about being involved in technology is the meetups.
The best ones are like school yards for adults, where friends can be made easily
cause we all know we have similar interests, and have gathered for the explicit
purpose of learning more and talking about them.

They are not structured "networking" events, where we are meant to deliberately
spend time making small talk with random people to figure out if they would help
make us money, get us a job, or generally be of use to us in the future somehow
(though that is a not uncommon side effect of enthusiastic nerds sharing their
interests).

The very evening that I moved permanently to Sydney (Australia), a place where I
had no family and few friends, I made a beeline directly for the Ruby community,
and was welcomed. Over the years, I gave talks, mentored new developers, made
new friends, and had lots of fun. Eventually, I became an organiser for the
[Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney (RORO)][] meetup, and after a couple of years,
added [Elixir Sydney][], [GraphQL Sydney][], and [Elm Sydney][] to my organiser
mix (I had to pass the RORO torch on to a new team, as four meetups became a bit
too much for me to handle, and I wanted at least _some_ free time).

I think I have learned some things about running meetups and community
building. So, in the spirit of all good tech meetups, I want to share what I
have learned, and hopefully convince you to actively participate in your own
local tech communities (and maybe even start your own...?).

## A Word about the Plague

With the advent of [COVID-19][], meetup dynamics changed completely from in-person
to online.

As of this writing, I would certainly not feel comfortable hosting in-person
events, for the sake of all participants, even if any of the venues who have
graciously allowed us to use their facilities in the past would permit them. The
logistics of hosting an online meetup are simpler than in-person, but new
challenges arise around keeping your community coming back to events.

My hope is that in-person meetups have not become obsolete, and will return in
the near future (and hence the information below about them will stay relevant),
but even when they do, there are definitely elements from online meetups that I
intend to bring into meatspace, which I will further elaborate on later.
