  Make your steno keyboard do your bidding by codifying your preferences.

So, you have had your [Georgi][] keyboard for a while, done lots of [Plover][]
[stenography][Stenotype] practice, and are now thinking about making some
changes to its keymap layout because you want it to do something that it
currently does not.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 90%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi.jpg"
         alt="Georgi keyboard">
  </figure>
</div>

This will require you to generate some
[Quantum Mechanical Keyboard (QMK)][QMK firmware]-based [firmware][] for the
Georgi, and then [flash][Firmware#flashing] the device to overwrite the one that
is currently there.

> See a previous blog post I wrote, _[Escape the defaults and Control your
> keyboard with QMK][]_, for more information about using QMK: some general,
> some more [Ergodox EZ][]-focused.

QMK has a [web-based configurator][QMK Configurator], which enables you to
create firmware files for a multitude of keyboards that QMK supports, without
having to touch any [C][] code. But, in the configurator[^1]...

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/qmk-configurator.jpg"
         alt="QMK Configurator">
  </figure>
</div>

- Compilation of the [Georgi layout][QMK Configurator Georgi Layout] is not yet
  supported
- [Stenography keycodes][] are not yet available to assign to keys

If you still want to make any changes, steel yourself for hard mode, because we
are going to have to get technical.

Before we even think about firmware customisation, though, we will want to
make sure that you can compile the _default_ Georgi firmware locally on your
computer, and flash your Georgi successfully with it. _Then_, we will get our
hands dirty with some code by creating an example firmware customisation,
compiling it, and then flash the Georgi again to apply it.

If you have not already, I would recommend familiarising yourself, at least a
little bit, with some of the Georgi-related [gBoards documentation][], to
provide some context on what we will be doing. Specifically:

- [Unboxing Georgi][] - we will use the [Gaming mode][] in the example
  customisation later on
- [Configuring Georgi][] - in particular [Triggers][], one of which we will
  change
- [Hacking Georgi][] - here, just note that we will be working with the
  [`cChord`][] [bit field][]

Ready? Let's get hacking!

## Compile Default Georgi Firmware

Download the QMK firmware from its [GitHub repository][qmk/qmk_firmware]. Pick
a convenient directory to start in (I will use `~/Desktop` here, but you can
pick one appropriate for your operating system), and either use [Git][] to get
the source code (recommended), or download its [ZIP][] file.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure style="margin-bottom: 0">
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/qmk-firmware-github.jpg"
         alt="QMK Firmware GitHub page">
  </figure>
</div>

Example commands:

```console
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git
cd qmk_firmware
```

Next, follow the [Setting Up Your QMK Environment][] instructions from the [QMK
documentation][] and install the `qmk` [command line interface][] (CLI)
application.

In the [Prerequisites][], it says installation of the [QMK Toolbox][] is
optional, but we will be using it soon, so either download [the latest
release][QMK Toolbox Releases], or, if you are on macOS, use [Homebrew][] to
install it:

```console
brew install qmk-toolbox
```

Now, use the `qmk` CLI to compile the default Georgi firmware with the following
command:

```console
qmk compile -kb georgi -km default
```

> You may get an error running this command the first time, and be prompted to
> run a command like `make git-submodule`. Follow any error message
> instructions, and then try compiling again.

If the command runs successfully, the end of all of the compilation output
should look something like this:

```console
...
Creating load file for flashing: .build/gboards_georgi_default.hex          [OK]
Copying gboards_georgi_default.hex to qmk_firmware folder                   [OK]
Checking file size of gboards_georgi_default.hex                            [OK]
```

If you check in your `qmk_firmware` directory, you will see that a
[HEX][] file named `gboards_georgi_default.hex` has been generated, which we
will use to flash the Georgi.

## Flash Georgi Firmware

Open up the QMK Toolbox application, press the "Open" button, and select the
generated HEX file.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">

    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/qmk-toolbox-select-firmware.jpg"
         alt="QMK Toolbox Select Firmware">
    <figcaption>
      Screenshot is macOS version of QMK Toolbox. May differ slightly for other
      operating systems.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

You will notice that the "Flash" button is currently not selectable. This is
because the Georgi is not currently in [Device Firmware Upgrade][] (DFU) mode.
To get in DFU mode, and allow the Georgi to receive firmware, you need to press
the tiny button on the left half of the keyboard, just below the [TRRS][] cable
plug. I use a paperclip or a [SIM card][] tray ejector tool for this delicate
job.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 80%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-flash-button.jpg"
         alt="Press button to put Georgi in DFU mode">
    <figcaption>
      Tray ejector tools are not just for mobile phones.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Once the button has been pressed, QMK Toolbox will show you a message letting
you know that you have successfully connected a device in DFU mode, and the
"Flash" button will become pressable:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/qmk-toolbox-dfu-device-connected.jpg"
         alt="QMK Toolbox DFU mode device successfully connected">
  </figure>
</div>

Press the "Flash" button, and if everything goes well, you should see output
that looks something like this:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/qmk-toolbox-flashing-successful.jpg"
         alt="QMK Toolbox device successfully flashed">
  </figure>
</div>

The Georgi has now been taken out of DFU mode, and can be reconnected to Plover.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 60%">

    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/reconnect-plover.jpg"

    <figcaption>
    My Georgi shows up as <code>/dev/cu.usbmodem14202</code> in Plover's
    connection list, but yours might look something like <code>COM6</code> if
    you use Windows.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

If you are able to stroke steno chords again (and it seems like nothing has
changed), congratulations, you have just completed a full keyboard flashing
process! You will get another chance to do this again, but before that, let's
actually go and make some firmware changes!

## Customising the Firmware

Before diving straight into the code, allow me to provide some context around
the reasons for even wanting to make the changes we will use in the
customisation example.

### The Problem

I have been experimenting with Georgi's [Gaming mode][], which switches you to a
separate keyboard layer that "acts like a traditional keyboard, as opposed to
stenotype", in the way it sends information to your computer.

This is different to Georgi's [QWERTY and Symbol modes][Georgi Modes], which
still both act like a stenotype, and actually only exist as
["pseudo-layers"][Georgi Layers] within the main steno keymap layer.

> important for this post).

If you have a look at the code for the Georgi [default keymap layers][Georgi
keymap.c], you will actually see only three layers, which have the following
layouts:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-steno-layer.png"
         alt="Steno (and QWERTY and Symbol) layer">
    <figcaption>
    Steno Layer (includes QWERTY and Symbol pseudo-layers; not shown above, but
    you can view them
    <a href="http://docs.gboards.ca/docs/Unboxing-Georgi/#modes">here</a>)
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-gaming-layer-1.png"
         alt="Gaming Layer 1">
    <figcaption>
    Gaming Layer 1
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-gaming-layer-2.png"
         alt="Gaming Layer 2">
    <figcaption>
    Gaming Layer 2
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

In order to change from the Steno layer to Gaming layer 1, the default chord is:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-steno-layer-gaming-chord.png"
         alt="Enter Gaming Mode chord">
    <figcaption>
    Enter Gaming Mode chord
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

In order to change from a Gaming layer to the Steno layer, the default keystroke
is:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-gaming-layer-steno-key.png"
         alt="Return to Steno Mode key">
    <figcaption>
    Return to Steno Mode key
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

My brain sees this as stroking a complex chord to change to Gaming Mode, yet
pressing a completely different singular key to change back to Steno Mode. I
would prefer to:

- have a single chord that that would feel like a "toggle" between Steno and
  Gaming modes
- make that chord a little bit simpler than the one above

### The Solution

I do not want to risk any dictionary-level outline conflicts, so the chord has
to include a Georgi-specific key (`FN` or `PWR`). Therefore, I am thinking a
`PWR | ST4` ("Star 4") combination will be a good candidate:

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-simple-gaming-chord.png"
         alt="Steno/Gaming toggle chord">
    <figcaption>
    Candidate Steno/Gaming "toggle" chord
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

The plan of attack to implement this toggle chord will be twofold:

- Change the hardcoded Georgi Gaming layer [trigger][Georgi trigger] on the
  Steno layer to be `PWR | ST4`
- Create an equivalent [QMK Combo][] shape (read: chord for a QWERTY keyboard)
  on the Gaming layer that returns to the Steno layer, using the "Left Control"
  and "H" keys

Let's give it a try!

### Change Gaming Layer Trigger

You will find all the logic for the triggers related to layer switching in
Georgi's [`sten.c`][Georgi sten.c] file. Inside the `send_steno_chord_user`
function, you can see that the chord for the gaming toggle is currently
hardcoded to `(PWR | FN | ST4 | ST3)`, as per the keymap above:

**`qmk_firmware/keyboards/gboards/georgi/sten.c`**

```c
// All processing done at chordUp goes through here
bool send_steno_chord_user(steno_mode_t mode, uint8_t chord[6]) {
    // ...
    // Handle Gaming Toggle,
    if (cChord == (PWR | FN | ST4 | ST3) && keymapsCount > 1) {
        // ...
        layer_on(1);
        goto out;
    }
    // ...
}
```

All we need to do here is change the chord that `cChord` is checked against
from `(PWR | FN | ST4 | ST3)` to `(PWR | ST4)`:

**`qmk_firmware/keyboards/gboards/georgi/sten.c`**

```c
// All processing done at chordUp goes through here
bool send_steno_chord_user(steno_mode_t mode, uint8_t chord[6]) {
    // ...
    // Handle Gaming Toggle,
    if (cChord == (PWR | ST4) && keymapsCount > 1) {
        // ...
        layer_on(1);
        goto out;
    }
    // ...
}
```

Made the change? Great! That wasn't too scary, right? Now to move out of
Georgi's core firmware logic, and into the keymap logic, where most
customisation typically occurs.

### Create Steno Layer Combo

Although we could not avoid changing core Georgi firmware logic in the previous
step, the general rule when you create your own personal keymap customisations
is to make a copy of the keymap directory you intend to change (in this case
Georgi's `default` keymap), and give it a unique name (in this case, I'll name
it `my_keymap`: unique, yet uncreative \[feel free to name it as you wish\]).

You can create the new directory via your [file manager][] user interface, or by
the command line:

```console
cp -r keyboards/gboards/georgi/keymaps/default/ keyboards/gboards/georgi/keymaps/my_keymap/
```

Now, open up the `keymap.c` file in the new `my_keymap` directory. Just above
the keymap definitions, add the following code to define a new QMK Combo, which
will mimic the Steno layer `(PWR | ST4)` chord we saw earlier, using the "Left
Control" and "H" keys:

**`qmk_firmware/keyboards/gboards/georgi/keymaps/my_keymap/keymap.c`**

```c
// ...
enum combos {
  GOTO_STENO_LAYER
};

// NOTE: This combo is meant to mirror the chord used to switch to the gaming
// layer in `sten.c`.
const uint16_t PROGMEM goto_steno_layer_combo[] = {
    KC_LEFT_CTRL, KC_H, COMBO_END
};

combo_t key_combos[COMBO_COUNT] = {
    [GOTO_STENO_LAYER] = COMBO(goto_steno_layer_combo, TO(STENO_LAYER)),
};

// ..
const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {
    // ..
};
```

> If you need a primer on QMK Combos, I wrote about them in excruciating detail
> in another blog post, [Chording QWERTY with QMK Combos][]. Most of the
> information in there should still be current as of this writing.

What we are doing here at a high level is:

- Giving a _name_ to the chord, in the form of an [enumerated type][], that
  indicates what it does: `GOTO_STENO_LAYER`
- Defining what keys the combo should consist of: the `KC_LEFT_CTRL`, and
  `KC_H` keys
- Defining what should happen when the chord is pressed: in this case
  `TO(STENO_LAYER)`, meaning to "turn on" the Steno layer

Next, we need to provide a definition for `COMBO_COUNT` above, which will need
to be put inside a new `config.h` file within the keymap directory, so create
that now:

**`qmk_firmware/keyboards/gboards/georgi/keymaps/my_keymap/config.h`**

```c
#include "../../config.h"

#define COMBO_COUNT 1
```

> If you add or remove combos in the future, you will also need to change this
> number accordingly.

Finally, we need to actually enable the use of combos in our layout, otherwise
we will get compilation errors for using things like `combo_t` and `COMBO_END`
above. Just add the following line of configuration to the keymap `rules.mk`
file:

**`qmk_firmware/keyboards/gboards/georgi/keymaps/my_keymap/rules.mk`**

```c
# ...
COMBO_ENABLE = yes
```

You have now done everything needed to implement the Gaming layer "toggle"
chord! Time to make sure everything compiles correctly:

```console
qmk compile -kb georgi -km my_keymap
```

Now, if you check in your `qmk_firmware` directory, you will see a newly
created HEX file named `gboards_georgi_my_keymap.hex` for you to use when
flashing. Different keymap compilations generate a separate firmware file.

If you get any errors, trace back and see if you may have missed a step, or
perhaps made a mistake in the code. If you get similar output to when you
compiled the `default` keymap, then you are ready to flash your Georgi again.
Repeat the firmware flashing steps from above, and give it a test!

If you want to see what other customisations can be made with Georgi Gaming
layers, feel free to use [my Georgi keymap][paulfioravanti/qmk_keymaps] as a
reference for any potential additions you may like to make to your own keymaps.

If you do create your own custom layers, please share them publicly so every
other Georgi owner can benefit from them as well! Good luck with your adventures
in firmware!
