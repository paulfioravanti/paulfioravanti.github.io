  So, am I a stenographer now, or what?
---

I first got into [stenography][] in late 2018, and wrote up a blog post about
_[Starting Stenography with an Ergodox][]_, which outlines how I started my
steno journey using an [Ergodox EZ][] mechanical keyboard.

One of the learning resources I used was [Typey Type][], an awesome web-based
typing application by [Diana MacDonald][]. I would use it occasionally over the
course of a few months until, unfortunately, my steno learning fell by the
wayside some time in early 2019. I then completely neglected it for the rest of
the year.

Come 2020, one of my New Year's resolutions was to get my steno learning back
on track, and Typey Type was going to be key. Typey Type keeps track of [your
progress][Typey Type progress] through its lessons, and provides you with a
percentage score based on how many words you have typed without mis-strokes.
It was this number that I latched on to: I wanted it to be 100%.

But, what was to stop yet another lapse in practice, resulting in writing off
yet _another_ year of potential progress? Accountability! I was able to find
another person who wanted to kick-start their steno-related activities, and we
became _[accountability buddies!][Accountability partner]_

## Define Success and Establish Cadence

First of all, we each defined and declared what success in our steno endeavours
would look like. Here is what I wrote back in January:

- 30 minutes minimum steno practice a day, preferably an hour
- I want to hit 100% progress on Typey Type this year (maybe this can take 6
  months on this schedule...?)
- It would be nice to have my steno speeds match, or at least approach, my
  [QWERTY][] typing speeds by the end of the year, so I can justify integrating
  it with my everyday workflows

Every week, without fail, I would need to send my accountability buddy an email
outlining what I had done in the last week to move forward towards completing
those goals.

I do not think I can possibly stress enough how _beneficial_ it was to have this
system in place:

- I had a deadline, every week, where someone was expecting to hear from me
- I did not want to have to report a lack of or no progress, which helped force
  me to keep up my routines
- Being able to report percentage gains towards the completion goal to an
  interested party felt great, and helped propel me forward
- I took an ["eat that frog"][Eat That Frog] approach to the timing of the
  30 minutes practice being first thing in the morning before breakfast, so I
  would not worry about it for the rest of the day, or while at work

For the first three months, I kept a schedule of 30 minutes steno practice a
day, every day, even if I did not want to do it, which, initially, was often.
Then, from the fourth month, I made a small increase to doing an hour a day on
weekends. Finally, seeing [this r/plover post][OMGGG!!! Finally!!!! 100 WPM on
simple exercise broken after a MAJOR down period!!!] spurred me to go up to an
hour steno practice every day, which I have been able to keep as of this
writing.

And so, after five months of practice, I finally reached **100% completion**,
meaning I have been able to type 10,000 words without mis-strokes.

I was initially worried that I was not hitting goals fast enough since I read of
people who were, say, getting up to 50 words-per-minute (WPM) after just a month
or two of steno practice. Maybe they had the luxury to dedicate their entire
full-time schedule to stenography, or maybe they were super-geniuses, or maybe
a bit of both....

Regardless, I needed to consciously ignore all this, not compare myself to
anyone else (real or imagined), and just _keep up the routine_. It may have
taken a while, but I do not mind; the journey has been beneficial and being able
to hit a goal feels great!

## Contributing Back

Aside from learning stenography through Typey Type, one of the other goals I
had was that if I find dictionary issues in Typey Type (incorrect or missing
words etc), I would make notes of them, and set aside time to file
[issues][Mastering Issues] and [pull requests][About Pull Requests] (PRs) to
[Typey Type's dictionary Github repository][didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries] as
close to finishing steno practice as possible.

This is particularly important to me. Typey Type is a _massively valuable_ piece
of [open source software][] that is being provided _for free_.  Given the value
I personally get from it, the _least_ I can do is to help improve it where I can.

As a software engineer, I use [Git][] and [Github][]
daily, so contributing back does not require any extra effort to learn new
tools; just the time to make notes and craft them into issues/PRs (there are
[other ways][Typey Type support] to get your proposals in, so do not let not
knowing Git or caring about Github stop you from proposing a dictionary entry
improvement!).

The process of contributing back also had the great knock-on effects of gaining
a deeper understanding about [Plover][] theory through researching discrepancies
between Typey Type and Plover dictionary entries, and receiving expert knowledge
from Diana in the interesting discussion threads on Github.

## Now What?

I may have "completed" Typey Type, but, there is still a long, _long_ road ahead
of me. I now know _viscerally_ that steno is _not_ something that I can casually
pick up: success is going to require continuous pushing until I can use steno in
daily typing in the way I currently use QWERTY. Steno feels more like learning a
new language than just a keyboard layout.

Since Typey Type has lots of activities outside of those scored 10,000 words,
I'm planning to continue doing them to learn ever more and hopefully build up
more muscle memory.

Just as important, though, is that I did not focus on gaining speed _at all_
during my practice, so I am still currently a very slow steno typist (read: less
than 20 WPM slow). I think the lack of gains I made in speed were made up for
with an increase in stroke intuition, but getting higher speeds remains a major
goal.

So, the grind may not be over, but I am still energised. I'm looking forward to
keeping up my current steno pace, and then taking stock again in another six
months to hopefully realise what could be my first successful completion of a
New Year's resolution.

## Postscript: Typey Type Tips

This section did not really fit within the body of the blog post, so it gets
tacked on at the end...

If you are currently using Typey Type or about to start, and maybe even thinking
of contributing back, here are some things I have learned along the way, in no
particular order.

- After downloading [Plover][], if you find that you are not getting the
  expected output when stroking words in Typey Type, chances are that this is
  because you are using Plover version 3.1.1 (the current
  [stable release][Plover 3.1.1]), while Typey Type dictionary entries are more
  optimised to favour Plover version 4 pre-release (the latest as of this
  writing being [`weekly-v4.0.0.dev8+66.g685bd33`][]) entries. So, I would
  currently recommend downloading pre-release versions to have a smoother steno
  experience. The latest information about installing Plover
  can always be found in its [Installation Guide][Plover Installation Guide]
- Your Typey Type progress file is stored in your browser, which means there is
  a non-zero chance you may accidentally delete it if you are ever too eager
  with clearing your browser data. Having lost my progress file once, I can
  recommend having backups. I back mine up to [Dropbox][] after every practice
  session.
- Plover's Lookup functionality has been my constant companion when using Typey
  Type. Whenever a word came up in Typey Type whose [outline][Learn Plover!
  Glossary] did not "feel quite right" to me, I would look the word up in Plover
  to see if there were any other outlines for that word that fit my brain
  better. If there were, I would sometimes submit these to the [Typey Type
  dictionary Github repo][didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries] as a potential
  change for consideration. Sometimes, an outline I thought better suited for a
  word would turn out to be a mis-stroke. So, it's also worth checking [Typey
  Type's mis-stroke dictionary][] to test your suspicions
- Many entries from [Typey Type's Top 1000 Project Gutenberg Words
  dictionary][], which appear in Typey Type practice exercises, use British
  English spelling. This means that there is a high chance that
  American-English-based Plover dictionaries will not have corresponding entries
  for those words. Typey Type does not necessarily need you to load up any other
  dictionaries aside from those that come bundled with Plover, but I would
  recommend that you download Di's [`dict-en-AU-with-extra-stroke.json`
  dictionary][] and add it to your list of default Plover dictionaries
  (`user.json`, `commands.json`, `main.json` etc) so you can stroke these words
  with ease
- If you cannot seem to get past a particular entry no matter what word you
  attempt to stroke, [fingerspelling][] the word will get you past it, and it
  will be logged as a successfully typed word in your progress

Good luck in your steno adventures!
