  Reflections on the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

On this day in 2011, I was leaving my office in [Yūrakuchō][], Tokyo, for a
dreaded afternoon meeting with a big [systems integrator][] company. As I walked
past the reception desk in the lobby and towards the elevators, I glanced up at
a TV screen and saw a map of Japan with a big red
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">X</span> to its northeast.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 50%">

Anyone who has lived in Japan is intimately familiar with these kinds of maps.
They are broadcast every time a significant quake occurs, which is often enough
that they do not capture much attention from anyone, including myself, as I
briskly continued on my way without giving it a second thought.
