On this day in 2011, I was leaving my office in [Yūrakuchō][], Tokyo, for a
dreaded afternoon meeting with a big [systems integrator][] company. As I walked
past the reception desk in the lobby and towards the elevators, I glanced up at
a TV screen and saw a map of Japan with a big red
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">X</span> to its northeast.

<div class="centered-image" style="width: 60%">

Anyone who has lived in Japan is intimately familiar with these images. They are
broadcast every time a "significant" quake occurs, but hardly anyone blinks
due to complete confidence in modern building construction codes. You enjoy (or
ignore) the rumble when it arrives, and then continue on with your day without
giving it a second thought.

A couple of seconds later, though, this particular
<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">X</span> made its presence known.
No rocking cradles or light shivers this time: the violent shaking literally
knocked everyone off their feet, with people screaming in terror as we grasped
for walls in futile attempts to balance ourselves. The huge building I was in
suddenly did not feel so stable; I honestly thought it would topple over,
flinging me through the huge office kitchen windows, and out over the tracks of
Yūrakuchō station.

Fortunately, those construction codes held up, and after a few of the most
intense minutes of my life, the still upright building's emergency systems
kicked into gear. Elevators were disabled, so we hurriedly descended down the
stairs from the twelfth floor in hopes of getting to ground before any potential
aftershocks hit.

The streets were full of calm but confused people. Mobile phone networks were
jammed, leading to massive, but orderly, queues outside public phone booths.
[3G][] internet was still usable, though, so social media ([Facebook][] only for
me at the time) became the only usable method for real-time communication.

After confirming our colleagues were out of the building, we all agreed that
work time was over, and we should make sure our homes and loved ones were safe.
So, at least I got out of attending that wretched meeting...

However, trains had stopped, bus stop queues were longer than those for phone
booths, and roads were at a complete standstill. All normal traffic rules had
been disregarded, as streets became pedestrian footpaths, and I merged in with
them for my long walk home across Tokyo.

As I passed [Shimbashi Station][], I joined a huge crowd of people that had
gathered around a big TV screen broadcasting the news, and could not believe
what I was seeing.

The images of a _[tsunami][]_ barreling through rural northern Japan and
annihilating everything in its path felt surreal. It took a moment to process
that this was indeed reality, and not a scene from _[Deep Impact][]_ or _[The
Day After Tomorrow]_. After a few minutes, I snapped out of my stupor, picked my
jaw up off the ground, and continued the long walk home.

My partner, Naoko, was out with friends for the day, and did not use newfangled
social media, so getting in direct contact with her was not possible. After a
couple hours walk, I managed to find a lonely public phone without a queue, and
called her mother on the other side of the country. If Nao reached out there, I
wanted her to know that I was safe, and that we should just try and meet back at
our apartment.

We had not planned for a natural disaster scenario of this magnitude, and hence
did not have emergency kits or food rations on-hand. I wagered we had enough
supplies to last us a week (maybe...? I had never had to judge that before...),
but just to make sure, I stopped by several convenience stores and supermarkets,
only to be greeted by rows of empty shelves. The city had already been cleaned
out.

I arrived home to discover my bicycle discarded in the park opposite. Someone
had tried to steal it (first time ever), but the cheap lock had been enough
security to move them on. Given the circumstances, I would not have minded if
they succeeded.

My apartment building was still standing, and inside, no damage at all. All I
could do now was wait: wait for the phone network to come back online, wait for
Nao to get home, wait for news about what was going on...

The next couple of days were punctuated by constant aftershocks. The haunting
chimes from the [Earthquake Early Warning][] system gave us a few seconds notice
to brace ourselves before another round of ground turbulence. It would have been
a luxury if another huge earthquake was the only thing we had to worry about,
but all the news about [problems at nuclear power plants][Fukushima nuclear
accident] had us anxious about whether we were actually witnessing the literal
end of Japan.

At the very least, the possibility we would have to flee from Tokyo felt very
real, so we packed some bags full of basic necessities, and left them by our
front door, ready to go should we need to leave quickly.

When images of [Fukushima Daiichi][]'s [Unit 3 Reactor hydrogen explosion][]
flashed across our screen on the afternoon of March 14, we felt the overwhelming
need to go. It was too late to get on a _[shinkansen][]_, so we left first thing
in the morning to just head west, and away from it all.

The strangest thing about going to the station and catching a train was just
how normal it felt. A literal explosion occurred at a nuclear power plant just
hours before, and there were _not_ hordes of people cramming the carriages to
get out of the city. Were we overreacting...?

The air of calm certainly gave me some pause, but if the situation got worse to
the point of everyone in Tokyo/eastern Japan [actually needing to
evacuate]['Worst-Case' Nuclear Scenario], a scenario that seemed less
far-fetched with every passing moment, I felt we would not get a second chance
at such a smooth run out of the city.

Arriving in [Kōchi][] was like entering a different universe, where the
earthquake had not happened, supermarket shelves were still full, and life was
peaceful. It was impossible to permanently ignore reality, of course, and we
were glued to all media for any morsels of information about the crisis.

I recall television just constantly playing strange cartoons, pushed by [Ad
Council Japan][], that extolled the value of greetings and other Japanese
virtues using animal puns, and thinking it to be a strange panic
mitigation/population distraction strategy. Oh, you wanted actual news about the
current existential threat? Nope, here's literally that same cartoon again. And
again and again.

video.

The next week was mostly a blur, but as it gradually became apparent that the
worst case scenario probably would not happen immediately, my employer's gentle
hints about considering getting back to work in the Tokyo office became concrete
orders to return. So, we begrudgingly left our rural retreat, hoping for the
best.

Essentials in the city were still in short supply, as efforts and resources were
deservedly redirected to the areas up north directly affected by the disaster.
I remember bottled water was impossible to find (and it was uncertain how
drinkable Tokyo's water was), so we had to get it shipped from Kōchi. This
worked for a while, until everyone else with family outside Tokyo followed the
same strategy, contributing to more supply shortages country-wide. But,
obviously, put into perspective, we managed just fine.

The earthquakes/aftershocks had not dissipated during the week we were away, and
you can bet every warning that flashed up on the screen now got our full
attention.

We now viscerally understood that although we may have to worry about how to
deal with the immediate consequences of a large earthquake, we would also have
to consider whether it is also a harbinger of further quakes to come.

For example, just two days before the big one hit...

Oh, you sweet summer child...you would not believe what's in store next...

Naoko and I ended up leaving Japan permanently at the end of 2011, as we were
definitely ready to try something new. But, living through this period certainly
instilled in us a newfound respect for the indifferent destructive forces of
nature, and the impermanence of physical things.

We still love visiting Japan, and go back regularly. But, if we ever end up
living there again, we like to think we will be much better prepared for
disasters, and certainly provide our full attention to all the inevitable
earthquake warnings.
