  "人" may be the _kanji_ for person, but its simplicity masks a deeper meaning.
---

The father of the bride was making his wedding toast. He recounted how his
daughter had left Japan alone to embark on an adventure to Australia, where she
met the man she would eventually marry.

I stood beside the father, translating his speech to English for the benefit of
the Australian locals in attendance. I am not a professional interpreter by any
means, but I thought I was doing pretty well.

The speech continued, with the father suggesting that since the bridegroom was
also a Japanese far from home, the couple could leverage their shared
experiences, and support each other as they move forward and grow in their new
life together.

The father then did something that completely threw me off guard.

He raised his two hands up to form a representation of "[人][]" (_hito_), the
_[kanji][]_ character for "person":

<div class="centered-image">
  <figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/2021-10-17/person-hands.jpg"
         alt="Hands in the shape of the Japanese character for person">
  </figure>
</div>

He then said:

<blockquote style="font-size: xx-large;">
  {% include japanese.html word="人" furigana="ひと" romaji="Hito" %}
  {% include japanese.html word="の" romaji="no" %}
  {% include japanese.html word="漢字" furigana="かんじ" romaji="kanji" %}
  {% include japanese.html word="は" romaji="wa" %}
  {% include japanese.html word="こう" romaji="kō" %}
  {% include japanese.html word="だから" romaji="dakara" %}
  {% include japanese.html word="ね。" romaji="ne." %}
  <br />
  <strong>The <em>kanji</em> for "person" looks like this.</strong>
</blockquote>

The Japanese in the audience smiled knowingly and laughed politely.

I stopped and looked at the father, waiting for some further information that
could help me contextualise what seemed like a complete [non sequitur][].

He looked back at me, hands still raised, waiting for his cue to continue after
my interpretation.

With no further assistance, nor any real idea of how to proceed through this
awkward pause, I felt I had no other choice but to also raise my hands into a
"人" shape, and just translate what had been said literally:

> "The _kanji_ for person looks like this...¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"

With a sympathetic shrug of the shoulders to the audience, who were clearly as
confused as I was, we continued on. Translation of the rest of the speech went
fine, but this "人" issue really stuck with me.

What did I miss that was so intuitively obvious to the Japanese in attendance,
but left me completely blindsided?

## Kinpachi-sensei

The answer lies with _[Kinpachi-sensei][]_
([3<ruby>年<rt>ねん</rt></ruby>B<ruby>組金八先生<rt>ぐみきんぱちせんせい</rt></ruby>][],
_San-nen B-gumi Kinpachi-sensei_), a long-running Japanese television drama that
portrays a variety of social issues faced by junior high school students.

[Tetsuya Takeda][] ([<ruby>武田<rt>たけだ</rt></ruby><ruby>鉄矢<rt>てつや</rt></ruby>][])
plays the titular role of school teacher Kinpachi Sakamoto, who sometimes
illustrates points of morality to his students by deconstructing parts of
_kanji_ characters to reveal their deeper hidden meanings.

During a scene in _Kinpachi-sensei_'s [4th special episode][], aired in 1985,
Kinpachi writes "人" on the classroom blackboard, and says to his students:

  Can I have your attention, please. So, the character for "person" consists of
  one person holding up and sustaining another person. In other words, it is a
  "person" precisely <em>because</em> a person and another person are supporting
  each other. A person gets support from other people and their community, and
  through that support, grows and develops as a human.
</blockquote>

So, our expectations about the composition of this character are flipped on
learning this new information: "人" is not a single character or "person", but
rather one person, `|`, leaning into another person, `|`, to form `人`.

For English speakers, the sentiment above perhaps has recognisable echoes of
the African proverb ["It takes a village to raise a child"][]. But for Japanese,
it resonated within the context of marriage, where two people "become one".

For the father of the bride, his daughter and new son-in-law would be leaning on
each other for support as they begin their life together, not as two
individuals, but as one family unit.

Hence, "人" represented the new form their relationship had evolved into.

## The Power of 人

The kicker to this romantic notion? It was [a complete lie][].

Takeda confirmed as much in an appearance he made in 2021 on The Wide Show
([ワイドナショー][]), a Japanese news and entertainment television program.

But, the meme has had decades to burrow into the collective consciousness of a
generation, and regardless of the generally accepted [glyph origin of 人][] to
be a "side view of a standing man, highlighting the arms and legs" (known before
Takeda made his admission, of course), I would wager we will see "人" appear
again at future weddings.

If I had my time again at that speech, knowing what I know now, I think I would
offer up the following translation for "the _kanji_ for 'person' looks like
this":

> **\[Hold both hands apart in a straight "`|`" formation\]**: "The bride and
> groom, once two individuals..."<br />
> **\[Bring hands together to form "`人`"\]**: "...have come together to become a
> single family unit, leaning on each other for support as they begin their new
> life together, forming this, the Japanese character for 'person'."<br />
> **\[Push hands slightly forward\]**: "These two have become one".

It's certainly not a literal translation, nor an academic one, nor one that
directly infers how the character of "人" is derived. Rather, it's just a short
bit of fanciful flourish that I think conveys enough meaning for the time given
without having to impart all the details given in this blog post.

So, if you ever somehow find yourself in a similar wedding-speech-interpreting
situation, feel free to use or riff on my translation, and hopefully that will
at least reduce your number of potential awkward pauses by one.
