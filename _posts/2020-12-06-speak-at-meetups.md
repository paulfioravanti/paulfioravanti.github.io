Meetups are great! The best ones provide a sense of community where the curious
and the enthusiastic can engage together to create a great experience that draws
people in and keeps them coming back.

Since my primary experience with meetups are those related to programming and
technology (as of this writing I organise the [Elixir Sydney][],
[GraphQL Sydney][], and [Elm Sydney][] meetups, and have previously organised
the [Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney][] meetup), this post will focus on meetups
where there is typically a roster of talks on software/technical topics, and a
good deal of socialising.

## Why Give a Talk?

If you are a developer, at any stage of your career or training, you should
_strongly consider_ finding a local meetup group (on [Meetup][] most likely),
and do a talk on something you have worked on, or have learned.

### Develop a New Skill

Presenting at a meetup is a win/win situation.

![Elixir Sydney Nerves talk][]

You, the speaker, get to practice public speaking, a skill that may not be
exercised much in your day to day activities, and your audience gets to leverage
your knowledge to learn new things that can potentially help them in their own
activities.

You may be apprehensive toward public speaking, particularly if you have
previously had negative experiences with it.

However, I posit that since technical meetups are typically attended by people
who lean more towards identifying as introverts than extroverts, and hence
viscerally understand the courage that it takes to deliver a talk in front of
your peers, you will find them to be a sympathetic audience who _want_ you to
succeed. Pre-talk nerves will never go away, but they can feel less debilitating
when you feel that your audience has your back.

Also, if you have ever thought that you would like to present at a big
conference, then a meetup audience is a great start point to get practice and
hone your skills.

### Add to your Portfolio

Doing a meetup talk provides takeaway artefacts of ["soft skills"][], which are
becoming ever more important in development teams (which makes me feel they
should be re-branded as "essential skills").

You can take your talk/slide deck and essentially open source it on a wide
variety of platforms, much like you would with your open source code (eg
[Speaker Deck][], [SlideShare][], or even [Github][] if your presentation is
written in [Markdown][]).

![Elixir Australia Online][]

[COVID-19][] has pushed many meetups out of [meatspace][] and into online
platforms like [Zoom][] (hopefully only temporarily...), allowing your talk to
be recorded easily. Check and see if your target meetup records talks, and
hopefully they have a space to publish content, like a [YouTube][] channel.

These artefacts, in their various forms, can provide a great addition to your
resume, or maybe even ammunition you can take in to your next pay-rise
negotiations.

### Show Something Off

Meetups provide you with a captive audience to directly promote and show off
something awesome you have built lately, or maybe pose a question or problems
that you'd like input and/or discussion around.

Discussion about any thought-provoking issues have often continued after the
meetup ends, and _you_ get to take the credit for being the catalyst!

### Practice Demoing

If you are up to the challenge, doing a talk can be a catalyst to practice
demoing something in front of an audience, which is significantly different to
just showing someone else what is currently on your screen.

![RORO Sonic Pi][]

Being able to effectively demo, and recover from any issues that occur during
them (and unless you have adequately appeased the [demo gods][], they will
happen), is a highly sought after developer (and [presales][]) superpower.

### Become an Expert

Doing a talk can have the pleasant side effect of making you known in your
community as an expert on something, even if don't consider yourself one!

If you teach someone something that they did not know before, then, to them, you
are an expert.

Furthermore, the questions that you get from others about what you know can lead
down extra knowledge-gathering paths to further refine your abilities, to the
point where even _you_ must acknowledge your own expertise. Not a bad
self-fulfilling prophecy!

### Your Perspective is Unique

Even if you think the content of your talk _must_ have been covered in a previous
meetup, or is just too obvious to talk about, your perspective on it (and the
way you present it) is unique to you, so never let that stop you from giving a
talk.

People love to hear presentations about things they already know because
it makes them feel smart about understanding something worth presenting.

![RORO Jora][]

If you are the one presenting it, you unconsciously join the league of experts
about that subject in your audience's mind, and I will bet anything that even
those experienced in the topic you present will learn _something_ from your
take.

### Land a Job

I have friends who have received offers to go and interview at organisations,
and consequently get jobs there, based solely on having done a talk at a meetup,
and impressing their future peers in the audience.

This scenario obviously does not play out at every meetup, but it goes to show
you that you never know who could be in your audience, and what opportunities
sharing your knowledge could provide you.

This "making your own luck" scenario is one of the primary reasons I
like to specifically appeal to junior developers to do meetup talks. A
successful talk delivered to your peers (and they are your peers), can help
your job application shine a bit brighter from the pack :sparkles:

## Leverage Organisers

Speaking from experience, meetup organisers are _always_ hungry for new content.
Finding talks is _easily_ the most difficult and time-consuming part of
technical meetup organisation.

If you are willing to freely spend time and effort creating content for a
meetup, then meetup organisers will very likely be happy to act as a sounding
board for your talk content and provide feedback before you present (I certainly
do, with pleasure!).

They will have seen a lot of talks, have likely delivered some themselves, and
will be invested in making your talk come out great. Good talks make for good
meetups, which then attracts more good talks in a virtuous circle, so your
success is their success!

## Leap of Faith

Deciding to take on delivering a technical talk is a hard first step to take,
but remember, it is _good_ to throw yourself out of your comfort zone and try
something different.

Who knows, you might even end up liking it and wanting to do more, which could
lead to all manner of new doors opening for you. Take that first step and find
out!
