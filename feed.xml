You will most likely be unable to, due to this keyboard/stenotype difference (details of which are not important for this post).</p> </blockquote> <p>If you have a look at the code for the Georgi <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/e9e83b4da73e5594b1f864d78529e85aa5ebefe9/keyboards/gboards/georgi/keymaps/default/keymap.c#L219">default keymap layers</a>, you will actually see only three layers, which have the following layouts:</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-steno-layer.png" alt="Steno (and QWERTY and Symbol) layer"/> <figcaption> Steno Layer (includes QWERTY and Symbol pseudo-layers; not shown above, but you can view them <a href="http://docs.gboards.ca/docs/Unboxing-Georgi/#modes">here</a>) </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-gaming-layer-1.png" alt="Gaming Layer 1"/> <figcaption> Gaming Layer 1 </figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-gaming-layer-2.png" alt="Gaming Layer 2"/> <figcaption> Gaming Layer 2 </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>In order to change from the Steno layer to Gaming layer 1, the default chord is:</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-steno-layer-gaming-chord.png" alt="Enter Gaming Mode chord"/> <figcaption> Enter Gaming Mode chord </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>In order to change from a Gaming layer to the Steno layer, the default keystroke is:</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-gaming-layer-steno-key.png" alt="Return to Steno Mode key"/> <figcaption> Return to Steno Mode key </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>My brain sees this as stroking a complex chord to change to Gaming Mode, yet pressing a completely different singular key to change back to Steno Mode. I would prefer to:</p> <ul> <li>have a single chord that that would feel like a “toggle” between Steno and Gaming modes</li> <li>make that chord a little bit simpler than the one above</li> </ul> <h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3> <p>I do not want to risk any dictionary-level outline conflicts, so the chord has to include a Georgi-specific key (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FN</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PWR</code>). Therefore, I am thinking a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PWR | ST4</code> (“Star 4”) combination will be a good candidate:</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-18/georgi-simple-gaming-chord.png" alt="Steno/Gaming toggle chord"/> <figcaption> Candidate Steno/Gaming "toggle" chord </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>The plan of attack to implement this toggle chord will be twofold:</p> <ul> <li>Change the hardcoded Georgi Gaming layer <a href="http://docs.gboards.ca/docs/Configuring-Georgi/#triggers">trigger</a> on the Steno layer to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PWR | ST4</code></li> <li>Create an equivalent <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/feature_combo.md">QMK Combo</a> shape (read: chord for a QWERTY keyboard) on the Gaming layer that returns to the Steno layer, using the “Left Control” and “H” keys</li> </ul> <p>Let’s give it a try!</p> <h3 id="change-gaming-layer-trigger">Change Gaming Layer Trigger</h3> <p>You will find all the logic for the triggers related to layer switching in Georgi’s <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/656090335066eed90a9b76e113fb93ee3bc8c089/keyboards/gboards/georgi/sten.c#L97"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sten.c</code></a> file.

Should you be running a certain amount of time per day, or per week? How fast should you be attempting to run? Do you have to start by running? What about jogging, or just walking?</p> <p>Answers to these questions eluded me. I did not want to end up paralysed into doing nothing, but also did not want to overexert myself into injury, or inability to continue longer term.</p> <p>Therefore, like any good computer programmer, I did the laziest thing possible: I outsourced building a running strategy to the well-known <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/">Couch to 5K</a> plan (C25K).</p> <p>Since it is just a plan, there are many different technical implementations of it, from the official <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/one-you-couch-to-5k/id1082307672">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phe.couchto5K">Android</a> apps, to <a href="https://www.active.com/mobile/couch-to-5k-app">the “Active”-branded iOS app</a> I somehow ended up using (I’d wager C25K apps are all pretty much interchangeable).</p> <p>With canned plan in hand, only the most difficult step remained: execution. I had to actually force myself to do this thing over the course of 9 weeks.</p> <h2 id="program-execution">Program Execution</h2> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 100%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-01/sporlab-XiZ7pRvCzro-unsplash.jpg" alt="pair of blue-and-white Adidas running shoes"/> <figcaption style="text-align: center;"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sporlab?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> sporlab </a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/running?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash </a> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>I was self-conscious about jogging during daylight hours. So, I decided to make things even more difficult for myself by going out at the social-distancing-friendly time of 5:00am, three times a week, and do whatever the app robot voice told me to do: “walk”, “brisk walk”, or “jog” at varying intervals.</p> <p>The only thing that made this even slightly bearable was listening to spoken-word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasts</a>. They enabled my brain to be distracted by focusing on stories and conversations, while my body and breathing went on auto-pilot to push me through each day of the programme.</p> <p>Although the podcasts helped, sticking to this routine, especially as 5:00am got colder and darker heading into winter, was an exercise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)">grit</a>. Every fibre of my being questioned the need to do this to myself, but I found that as long as I could actually pull myself out of bed, that would be enough momentum to get me out the door, and into the chilly morning air.</p> <blockquote> My wife's nickname for me during this time became "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla">Godzilla</a>", due both to my early morning water vapour breath resembling his "atomic breath", and it being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_play">play on words</a> from the original Japanese pronunciation, <strong>Gojira</strong> (ゴジラ), where <strong>goji</strong> can also mean 5 o'clock (becoming <span class="japanese-with-furigana-romaji"> <ruby class="japanese"> <ruby> ５ <rp>(</rp> <rt style="ruby-align: center; text-align: center; padding-left: 8px;"> ゴ </rt> <rp>)</rp> </ruby> </ruby> <ruby class="japanese"> <ruby> 時 <rp>(</rp> <rt style="ruby-align: center; text-align: center; padding-left: 8px;"> ジ </rt> <rp>)</rp> </ruby> </ruby> </span> ラ). </blockquote> <p>Sometimes, I did lose the battle with my wake-up alarm, necessitating catch up sessions on concurrent days if I was going to stick to C25K’s schedule of 3 runs per week. Sometimes, the battle got lost for me: I pulled both of my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calf_(leg)">calf</a> muscles at least once during the course of the C25K, resulting in me limping home and resting for a few days (so just know that if you are going to try this, expect that you will probably lightly injure yourself, and it is not the end of the world).</p> <p>But, every completed run got me that one small step toward finishing the 27 runs the C25K plan had laid out for me (9 weeks x 3 runs per week). The desire to complete this “game”, and those small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">dopamine</a> hits I got after each completed “stage”, provided enough incentive to propel me forward to the end.</p> <h2 id="return-value">Return Value</h2> <p>The rewards I got for completing the program were:</p> <ul> <li>the satisfaction of having hit a goal I set</li> <li>being actually able to run 5 kilometres for the first time in probably ever</li> <li>a general elevated sense of well-being I had not felt for many years</li> <li>becoming a “morning person” by force</li> <li>thinking that maybe I had decreased my chances of being severely impacted by, or dying from, COVID-19</li> </ul> <p>These were all well and good, but now that the goal was done, so was the structure I had relied on for the last 9 weeks to haul myself out of bed.</p> <p>In an attempt to continue momentum, and confirm that getting to 5K was not a one-time fluke, I ended up repeating the final day of the plan 12 more times, playing out a long goodbye to my robot friend.</p> <p>After that got tiresome, I moved on to the app’s “free run” step, containing no robot guidance, which seems to exist as just a general bucket to log run information. 14 “free runs” later, and I started to get the same feeling as when I have completed all the missions and side quests in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world">open world</a> game, and the urge to continue starts fizzling out.</p> <p>I was treading water. The C25K app had successfully served its purpose, and it was time to graduate away from it.</p> <h2 id="long-running-process">Long Running Process</h2> <p>Enter <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>, probably the most directly beneficial social media app I currently use.</p> <p>As well as logging runs, I have gotten Strava to plot routes on maps for me to run based on what distance I want to try, leading to discovering more of my local area from the ground level. <a href="https://blog.strava.com/routes/">Plotting routes near you</a> is actually a feature for paid subscribers only; after using Strava for a few months with a free account, I decided that it was worth trying out its paid features, and so far, I have no regrets.</p> <p>Wanting to explore routes farther out has gradually lifted the distances I currently run: from 5 kilometres when I first started, to 8 kilometres on an average weekday, and about 10 kilometres on weekends, when I have more time.</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 90%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2022-05-01/lucas-favre-JnoNcfFwrNA-unsplash.jpg" alt="silhouette photo of a person running on road"/> <figcaption style="text-align: center;"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@we_are_rising?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> lucas Favre </a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/running?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash </a> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>And I want to do more. What was a huge grind when I first started is now just a part of my life routine, and I actually start to <em>miss</em> running — this boring activity — if I have been unable to do it for a couple of days.</p> <p>Seeing the activities of friends that I follow also provides some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_partner">accountability buddy</a>-like benefits, keeping me going so I have something to show for myself on my timeline.</p> <p>Overall, I can definitely recommend giving it a try if you plan to start running or cycling, and I am sure it is better for your physical and mental health than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">doomscrolling</a> through the <a href="https://twitter.com/home">bird site</a>.</p> <h2 id="running-toolkit">Running Toolkit</h2> <p>In order to make walking-but-faster as bearable and safe as possible, I found that I needed to open my wallet a few times. Aside from the aforementioned Strava paid account, here is where that money has gone:</p> <h3 id="shoes">Shoes</h3> <p>By far the most comfortable shoes I’ve used for running, or even just general use, are <a href="https://www.adidas.com.au/ultraboost">Adidas Ultraboost</a>. I own multiple pairs, and rotate them on every run in hopes they will last longer.</p> <p>They are quite pricey, so I try and stock up on them when they go on sale.</p> <h3 id="earbuds">Earbuds</h3> <p>I’m mostly a slave to the Apple ecosystem, so I have a set of <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/">Airpods Pro</a>. These generally function well, but I found that due to their absence of ear hooks, they would often annoyingly fall out of my ears as I worked up a sweat.</p> <p>I unsuccessfully attempted to use <a href="https://symbioeartips.com/">Symbio ear tips</a> to keep the Airpods in, and it was only when I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0837G66Q5">AhaStyle Ear Hooks Covers</a> that I was able to get them to stay firmly in place. The only drawback to using them is having to take the hooks on and off for every run, since the Airpods cannot fit back in their charger when the hooks are on.</p> <p>I now consider it a design flaw that Airpods do not come with some kind of ear stabilisers, especially since other comparable earbud models, like the <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earbuds/bose-sport-earbuds.html">Bose Sport Earbuds</a>, which I have also enjoyed using, have hooks built in. Here’s hoping that Apple sees fit to remedy this on future iterations of their product.</p> <h3 id="headlamp">Headlamp</h3> <p>It is generally dark at 5:00am, so if you are planning to go out for a run at that time, it can help tremendously if you can actually see where you are going (who knew?).</p> <p>There are many types of running headlamps on the market at varying price points. I know that I don’t know a lot about them, and so decided to get a very entry level model at a low price point, the <a href="https://www.foxelli.com/collections/headlamps/products/headlamp-mx20">Foxelli MX20 Headlamp</a>. It has worked well for me running in urban areas that are at least moderately lit by street lamps. However, it has fallen short of providing adequate visibility where that ambient light is in short supply, like off-street paths and bush trails.</p> <p>So, I am currently investigating other models that can up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit)">lumens</a> of light without weighing down my head, or costing a fortune.</p> <h2 id="just-do-something">Just Do Something</h2> <p>Speaking as someone that took care of his body during his teens, but not during his 20s and 30s, and is attempting to pay down that debt now by trying to care again in his 40s, I obviously wish I had changed my mindset sooner. But, better late than never.</p> <p>I now more viscerally understand that I spent too much time focusing on improving my mind as a developer, at the expense of body maintenance. After a morning run, my mind feels a lot sharper, and ready to tackle a day of fighting computers, so it doesn’t even make sense to have avoided doing this for so long, given the benefits.</p> <p>So, if you are finding that you are devoting <em>all</em> your self-improvement efforts towards your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">ghost, rather than your shell</a>, I would urge you to try to diversify your effort investments, and help give some balance to your human portfolio.</p>]]></content><author><name>Paul Fioravanti</name><email>paul@paulfioravanti.com</email><uri>https://www.paulfioravanti.com</uri></author><category term="fitness"/><category term="running"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The act of running is boring, so I grinded until I could tolerate it.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mum’s Meetup</title><link href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/mums-meetup/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mum’s Meetup"/><published>2021-11-17T13:05:00+11:00</published><updated>2021-11-27T23:05:00+11:00</updated><id>https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/mums-meetup</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/mums-meetup/"><![CDATA[<div class="post-audio"> <div class="post-audio-video"> <div class="responsive-video-container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ehi-ett4PWM" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> </div> <div class="spacer"></div> <div class="text"> :studio_microphone: This post has audio narration </div> </div> <p>When you run a meetup, one of the more difficult things to gauge can be whether you’re actually doing it right.</p> <p>Feedback can be elusive, so it can be hard to know if this event that you put on has some value for, or is meaningful to, the people that come along.</p> <p>One day, though, I did get some feedback about a meetup from the most unlikely of places, and it helped reframe my views on the importance of community and human connection.</p> <hr/> <p>I have written posts encouraging participation in meetups before (<em><a href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/speak-at-meetups/">Speak at a Meetup</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/organise-meetups/">Organise a Meetup</a></em>), but of all my attempts at evangelising this, I think I am most proud of having gotten one particular person into the meetup game:</p> <p>My mother.</p> <p>When Mum retired after a long career in education, I worried about how she would fill her days.</p> <p>Work constituted an important part of her life, and kept her constantly busy. With her children occupied with their own lives, no other family, few close friends who were, themselves, still working, and no specific hobbies that involved socialising, what would she do with herself?</p> <p>I was organising the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney">Ruby on Rails Oceania Sydney</a> meetup at the time, and suggested that she try finding some communities that interested her, and go along to their events.</p> <p>Making new friends is harder as you get older, so she was hesitant at first. But, after talking up the benefits that I got from meetup participation after moving to a new city where I knew no one, she took the plunge.</p> <p>It was an over-50s social meetup, and on her first timid steps into the event space, the organiser rushed over, welcomed her with a big smile, and introduced her to some of the other members of the group.</p> <p>First impressions from the initial meetup were so good that Mum started regularly attending almost immediately. All the new people she met at the meetup, the places they went to, and the activities they did together, became a staple feature of our conversations.</p> <p>Frequent participation at the meetup events led Mum to become well-known and trusted. It was not long before she was invited into the leadership team, started running specific events for members, and eventually took on more responsibility as one of the main meetup organisers.</p> <p>And when Mum runs a meetup, much like when she ran a single-parent household, you will find no <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/half%20measure">half measures</a>: multiple social events every week, from pub gatherings to cultural excursions to dinner parties.</p> <p>Between running her own events, helping others run theirs, scouting new venues for future potential meetups, handling new memberships (including dealing with financials), general <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/herd_cats">cat herding</a>, and managing the drama found in large social groups of people with various personalities and temperaments, there is no doubt I would define it as a full-time job.</p> <p>Mum and I essentially became peers in this meetup space, though the amount of effort involved in her meetups leaves my own credentials as a so-called “organiser” of some <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dinky">dinky</a> technical meetups once a month in the dust!</p> <p>I am glad to have been shown up, though, as Mum’s passion and enthusiasm for meetup organisation and bringing people together led to her to become a happier, and even more outgoing, person.</p> <hr/> <p>We held Mum’s wake in the same pub we celebrated her 60th birthday some years earlier.</p> <p>More than a hundred people crammed into the room we had reserved to farewell Mum<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and I delivered a tearful eulogy to a group of unfamiliar faces.</p> <p>But, they all knew Mum from the meetup.</p> <p>Over the course of the afternoon, I got to meet many of them, and receive their memories of Mum, each recount a small gift to my mourning soul.</p> <p>One, though, in particular, stood out:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Your Mum saved my life.”</p> </blockquote> <p>I smiled politely, but as if to immediately quash any potential thoughts of hyperbole, they continued on that no, really, they were mentally in a very dark place when they first went on a whim to one of Mum’s meetups.</p> <p>But, Mum took care of them immediately, got them talking to others, which led to conversations that grew into friendships.</p> <p>And that’s what kept them going, enabling them to be there, at the wake, on that day.</p> <hr/> <p>So, I got to take that feedback, on behalf of Mum, and attempt to apply it to my own meetups. Getting together to nerd out over programming languages seems unlikely to save a life in my mind, but, ultimately, who’s to say?</p> <p>You may not know, nor ever know, the impact on others of whatever you put out in the world. I think as long as the effort is worth the intrinsic value you get from it, it’s okay to just keep doing it.</p> <p>In times of plague, it has admittedly been tough to keep up a feeling of community when we are all apart, and the interface to meetups is the same as every work meeting you have been forced to attend on <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>.</p> <p>But, I hope that having persevered with them, even in a remote format, is considered better than not, and that once we reach whatever ends up passing for normality, real human connection (and maybe even shared :pizza:?) can come back to meetups.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Early 2019, pre-normalisation of social distancing <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div>]]></content><author><name>Paul Fioravanti</name><email>paul@paulfioravanti.com</email><uri>https://www.paulfioravanti.com</uri></author><category term="meetups"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Organising a meetup gave my Mum a new lease on life.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Person’s Character (人という字は)</title><link href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/persons-character/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Person’s Character (人という字は)"/><published>2021-10-17T16:14:00+11:00</published><updated>2021-12-04T14:00:00+11:00</updated><id>https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/persons-character</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/persons-character/"><![CDATA[<div class="post-audio"> <div class="post-audio-video"> <div class="responsive-video-container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TlkoRxyb7E4" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> </div> <div class="spacer"></div> <div class="text"> :studio_microphone: This post has audio narration </div> </div> <p>The father of the bride was making his wedding toast.

So, the character for "person" consists of one person holding up and sustaining another person. In other words, it is a "person" precisely <em>because</em> a person and another person are supporting each other. A person gets support from other people and their community, and through that support, grows and develops as a human. </blockquote> <p>So, our expectations about the composition of this character are flipped on learning this new information: “人” is not a single character or “person”, but rather one person, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>, leaning into another person, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>, to form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">人</code>.</p> <p>For English speakers, the sentiment above perhaps has recognisable echoes of the African proverb <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_takes_a_village">“It takes a village to raise a child”</a>. But for Japanese, it resonated within the context of marriage, where two people “become one”.</p> <p>For the father of the bride, his daughter and new son-in-law would be leaning on each other for support as they begin their life together, not as two individuals, but as one family unit.</p> <p>Hence, “人” represented the new form their relationship had evolved into.</p> <h2 id="the-power-of-人">The Power of 人</h2> <p>The kicker to this romantic notion? It was <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/709a167033b56d303ec2f93ce5609892e7309d62">a complete lie</a>.</p> <p>Takeda confirmed as much in an appearance he made in 2021 on The Wide Show (<a href="https://www.fujitv.co.jp/widna-show/">ワイドナショー</a>), a Japanese news and entertainment television program.</p> <p>But, the meme has had decades to burrow into the collective consciousness of a generation, and regardless of the generally accepted <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA/derived_terms#Glyph_origin">glyph origin of 人</a> to be a “side view of a standing man, highlighting the arms and legs” (known before Takeda made his admission, of course), I would wager we will see “人” appear again at future weddings.</p> <p>If I had my time again at that speech, knowing what I know now, I think I would offer up the following translation for “the <em>kanji</em> for ‘person’ looks like this”:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>[Hold both hands apart in a straight “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>” formation]</strong>: “The bride and groom, once two individuals…“<br/> <strong>[Bring hands together to form “<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">人</code>”]</strong>: “…have come together to become a single family unit, leaning on each other for support as they begin their new life together, forming this, the Japanese character for ‘person’.”<br/> <strong>[Push hands slightly forward]</strong>: “These two have become one”.</p> </blockquote> <p>It’s certainly not a literal translation, nor an academic one, nor one that directly infers how the character of “人” is derived. Rather, it’s just a short bit of fanciful flourish that I think conveys enough meaning for the time given without having to impart all the details given in this blog post.</p> <p>So, if you ever somehow find yourself in a similar wedding-speech-interpreting situation, feel free to use or riff on my translation, and hopefully that will at least reduce your number of potential awkward pauses by one.</p>]]></content><author><name>Paul Fioravanti</name><email>paul@paulfioravanti.com</email><uri>https://www.paulfioravanti.com</uri></author><category term="japanese"/><category term="日本語"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA["人" may be the _kanji_ for person, but its simplicity masks a deeper meaning.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pipe a Codebase into Ruby</title><link href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/pipe-codebase-into-ruby/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pipe a Codebase into Ruby"/><published>2021-10-10T20:50:00+11:00</published><updated>2021-10-10T20:50:00+11:00</updated><id>https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/pipe-codebase-into-ruby</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/pipe-codebase-into-ruby/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alistairtweed">Alistair Tweed</a> asked an interesting question on the <a href="https://ruby.org.au/">Ruby Australia</a> <a href="https://ruby-au-join.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a>, which I thought deserved a more permanent home over being banished to <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>’s archives:</p> <blockquote> <p>Can anyone help me with getting user input when piping code to Ruby?<br/> The command I’m using is:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | ruby

From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1vyuny/ceci_nest_pas_une_pipe/"> r/ProgrammerHumor </a> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Yes, we could <em>just</em> change the command to pass the file directly to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code>, and manually type in a name when <a href="https://rubyapi.org/o/kernel#method-i-gets"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gets</code></a> prompts for it:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>ruby hello
Mario
Hello, Mario!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We could also use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Process-Substitution.html#Process-Substitution">process substitution</a> to allow us to provide a name as an argument when running a command:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>ruby hello &lt;<span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">echo </span>Mario<span class="o">)</span>
Hello, Mario!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The codebase, as it stands, only really gives unexpected results when we ignore the input prompt (ie just press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Enter]</code>):</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>ruby hello
&lt;press Enter&gt;
Hello, <span class="o">!</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Pressing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Enter]</code> sends an empty string (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code>), not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, and since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code> is a <a href="https://learn.co/lessons/truthiness-in-ruby-readme">truthy value in Ruby</a>, when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name || 'World'</code> gets evaluated, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> gets output.</p> <p>This could be fixed by changing final line of the code to something like:</p> <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hello, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">empty?</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="s1">'World'</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!"</span>

&lt;press Enter&gt;
Hello, World!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>But! We are going to consider all of the above as <em>out of scope</em> for answering this question, and we are going to take the use of a pipe as an <em>unchangeable</em> (hard) requirement.</p> <h2 id="down-the-pipe">Down the Pipe</h2> <div class="centered-image"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2021-10-10/Mario!_(86871905).jpg" alt="The Manchester Mario"/> <figcaption> The Manchester Mario. <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mario!_(86871905).jpg"> Pete Birkinshaw from Manchester, UK </a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0"> CC BY 2.0 </a>, via Wikimedia Commons </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Back to the problem at hand. Running the original command, we get the following:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | ruby
Hello, World!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The codebase is being passed over to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code>, so that we end up with a command that looks something like:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruby &lt;code&gt;
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We want to be able to capture a reference to that code being passed over via the pipe, so that we can inject arguments into it, and create a command that looks something like:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruby &lt;code&gt; <span class="o">[</span>arguments]
</code></pre></div></div> <h3 id="xargs">xargs</h3> <p>Whenever I want to do something potentially complex with piped-in arguments, I tend to reach for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs">xargs</a> utility first. Let’s see what we can do with it.</p> <p>We will start with attempting to get the most basic command running first (without any arguments), follow the trail of errors until it works, add in arguments, then rinse and repeat.</p> <p>First let’s just try passing the code through xargs and see what happens:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | xargs ruby
/../bin/ruby: No such file or directory <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env (LoadError)</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>It looks like we are only passing the first line of the file over to Ruby, rather than the entire file.</p> <p>This would seem to indicate that we have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs#Separator_problem">separator problem</a>: xargs is not a line-oriented tool, but also separates on spaces.</p> <p>Looking back at the file, it’s first line is:</p> <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>xargs has separated on the space between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code>, resulting in the error above. Fortunately, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-0</code> flag deals with this problem, so let’s add it in:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | xargs <span class="nt">-0</span> ruby
/../bin/ruby: No such file or directory <span class="nt">--</span> <span class="c">#!/usr/bin/env ruby (LoadError)</span>
<span class="c"># frozen_string_literal: true</span>

name <span class="o">=</span> gets&amp;.strip

puts <span class="s2">"Hello, #{name || 'World'}!"</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Okay, it looks like the whole file is being passed through this time, but we are still getting the same error. It would seem that perhaps <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> is not evaluating the code it is getting passed.</p> <p>We can fix this by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code>’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-e</code> flag:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | xargs <span class="nt">-0</span> ruby <span class="nt">-e</span>
Hello, World!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Great! We now have the default case working with xargs!</p> <p>But, we still need a reference to the Ruby code being piped through so that we can then give <em>it</em> arguments.</p> <p>To do that, we can use xargs’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-I</code> option, and name the variable however we want. Let’s call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rubycode</code>:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | xargs <span class="nt">-0I</span> rubycode ruby <span class="nt">-e</span> rubycode
Hello, World!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>So far, so good. Now, what happens when we use process substitution to provide a name argument…?</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | xargs <span class="nt">-0I</span> rubycode ruby <span class="nt">-e</span> rubycode &lt;<span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">echo </span>Mario<span class="o">)</span>
Hello, Mario!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Looks like we have ourselves a working command! Ship it! :shipit:</p> <h3 id="xargs-1">!xargs</h3> <p>Looking back at the command, I cannot help but think that using xargs is overkill for this kind of problem. The pipe is passing the code through as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)">standard input</a> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdin</code>), we use xargs to “catch” it, assign it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rubycode</code> variable, and then pass that variable on to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code>.</p> <p>Surely we can do the same thing with just plain bash code, right? Let’s give it a try by using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html">command substitution</a> to capture the output of a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html">redirection</a> of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdin</code> into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rubycode</code> variable.</p> <p>As we did with xargs, we can then use that variable in the Ruby command:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | <span class="nv">rubycode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">$(</span>&lt; /dev/stdin<span class="si">)</span><span class="p">;</span> ruby <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$rubycode</span><span class="s2">"</span> &lt;<span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">echo </span>Mario<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">[</span>No output]
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Hmmm…getting no output here is unexpected.</p> <p>And, indeed, it would seem that I have neglected to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Grouping.html">group these commands together</a> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(</code>parentheses<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">)</code>, so that the redirection that gets assigned to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rubycode</code> variable can be applied to the other command when it gets referenced in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> command:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | <span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">rubycode</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="si">$(</span>&lt; /dev/stdin<span class="si">)</span><span class="p">;</span> ruby <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$rubycode</span><span class="s2">"</span> &lt;<span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">echo </span>Mario<span class="o">))</span>
Hello, Mario!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And we are back to working again! But, we can probably make this a little bit more compact without sacrificing readability.</p> <p>Let’s get rid of the intermediate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rubycode</code> variable, which removes a command, meaning no need for any grouping:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | ruby <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">$(</span>&lt; /dev/stdin<span class="si">)</span><span class="s2">"</span> &lt;<span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">echo </span>Mario<span class="o">)</span>
Hello, Mario!
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Success! At this point, I think I would consider the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">yak shaved</a>, and leave it at that.</p> <p>There are two other minor refactors I can think of, which we will go through below for completeness’ sake (said very loosely: “completeness” as in “all I could think of right now”, as I am sure there are more ways to do many of the commands in this post), but I personally think they sacrifice readability.</p> <h3 id="bonus-shave">Bonus Shave</h3> <p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/cat-invocation.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code></a> command, if no arguments are provided, copies the contents of what it receives from standard input to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)">standard output</a> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdout</code>). This means that we do not need to grab a reference to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdin</code> and redirect it, but can instead just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> command:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cat </span>hello | ruby <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">$(</span><span class="nb">cat</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s2">"</span> &lt;<span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">echo </span>Mario<span class="o">)</span>

If you are interested in those changes, see the <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/cypress-i18n-example/tree/main/cypress/support"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">support</code> directory</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/cypress-i18n-example">Cypress I18n Example</a> application.</p> <h2 id="all-green">All Green</h2> <p>Most of the other tests in the suite are quite similar in format to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">changing_language.spec.js</code>, and build off of functionality that we have already seen. So, I will leave it to any interested parties to have a look at the rest of the test suite in detail.</p> <p>Suffice to say, that all the tests do pass, and you should be able to see below a test for every feature described in the use case set towards the top of this post:</p> <div> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2021-10-06/full-test-suite-all-apps-cypress.gif" alt="Full passing test suite in Cypress for both apps"/> </figure> </div> <p>There is one <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gotcha">gotcha</a>, though, that is worth bringing up: the applications would seem to sometimes inexplicably fail to register clicks on the language menu when the suite ran at full speed. This resulted in tests randomly failing, and much frustration and confusion on my part.</p> <p>Trawling through the <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress">Cypress GitHub repository</a> surfaced <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1847">this issue</a>, seemingly indicating that there was a time where clicks were not being registered properly due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseover_event"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mouseover</code> events</a> not being fired. <a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1847#issuecomment-447996153">The workaround</a> was to manually fire the event before clicking using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.trigger("mouseover").click()</code>.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3030">This pull request</a> introduced automatic firing of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mouseover</code> events for clicks, but only for clickable input tags like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;</code>s. The language menu in our application is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, so it does not benefit from auto-firing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mouseover</code> events, but manually adding that to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">clickLanguageMenu</code> command fixed the issue (and gave me a new rule-of-thumb for clicking elements in Cypress):</p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cypress/support/commands.js</code></strong></p> <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">Cypress</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Commands</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">clickLanguageMenu</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

Rather, we start off with a socket connection (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conn</code>, a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Conn.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Plug.Conn</code></a>), and use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveViewTest.html#live/2"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">live/2</code></a> to spawn a stateful LiveView process (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">view</code>), that we can then interact with like we would a web page:</p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test/phx_i18n_example_web/integration/changing_language_test.exs</code></strong></p> <div class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">defmodule</span> <span class="no">PhxI18nExampleWeb</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">ChangingLanguageTest</span> <span class="k">do</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Since we are not working with a browser, we have to inject the language cookie value directly into the raw connection, using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Test.html#put_req_cookie/3"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">put_req_cookie/3</code></a>, in order to change the LiveView’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">language</code> (passed up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup</code> from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@tag</code> attribute on the test) to English.</p> <p>From there, we perform <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveViewTest.html#render_click/1"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">render_click/1</code></a> actions to open the language dropdown menu, select a language, and then extract the LiveView page title and heading to send into the test itself.</p> <p>For testing LiveViews in isolation, I think these kinds of tests are absolutely fine. However, where I think Cypress does get an upper hand in this use case, and some others in the application, is, as you may expect, related to its tests being run in a browser:</p> <ul> <li>No manual injection of cookies are needed into the application; Cypress can set cookie values directly in the browser, which the application can then read in and use</li> <li>Once the language is set, Cypress is able to <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/reload"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cy.reload()</code></a> the browser to confirm that the new language is set in the cookies (check the Github repo for that test), but doing something like checking whether a cookie value has been changed in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conn</code> is not feasible, and LiveViews cannot be “reloaded”</li> </ul> <h3 id="elm-tests">Elm Tests</h3> <p><a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/">The Elm Architecture</a> (TEA) breaks Elm applications up into three parts:</p> <ul> <li>Model — the state of your application</li> <li>View — a way to turn your state into HTML</li> <li>Update — a way to update your state based on messages</li> </ul> <p>When attempting to write an “integration test” in Elm, you are able to initialise a model and pass it into a view to render.</p> <p>However, unlike a LiveView, it is not possible to trigger multiple events on a view (eg click language dropdown, <em>and then</em> select a language) that then updates the state of a model, or the view itself, so that assertions can be made on it.</p> <p>It is not even possible to do this for a single event: the only assertions we can make based off of an event being triggered are <em>that</em> a certain type of message gets generated.</p> <p>For example, in the test below we:</p> <ul> <li>Initialise a model using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Main.init</code></li> <li>Change the model values to indicate that the language menu should be open (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">showAvailableLanguages = True</code>), and that the current language is Italian ( the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Translations.It</code> type)</li> <li>Render the model in the view and find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"English"</code> from the language dropdown menu</li> <li><a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-explorations/test/latest/Test-Html-Event#simulate"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Event.Simulate</code></a> a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">click</code></li> <li>Assert that a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Msg.ChangeLanguage Translations.En</code> message gets generated</li> </ul> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tests/ChangingLanguageTest.elm</code></strong></p> <div class="language-elm highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="kt">ChangingLanguageTest</span> <span class="k">exposing</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Similar to my opinions about the Elixir tests, I think these tests are totally fine for testing parts of an Elm application in isolation.</p> <p>There are some other Elm options to enable testing programs as more complete units, negating the need to divide up tests, like <a href="https://github.com/avh4/elm-program-test">elm-program-test</a> (does not drive a web browser), or <a href="https://github.com/justgook/elm-webdriver">Elm-WebDriver</a> (drives a web browser), so there are other options outside of Elm’s default testing paradigms.</p> <p>However, for similar reasons as the Elixir tests, I think there is a strong case for involving Cypress’ power and flexibility in the testing mix for Elm applications.</p> <h2 id="an-aside-testing-internationalisation">An Aside: Testing Internationalisation</h2> <p>The purpose of the Phoenix and Elm I18n example applications are just that: to be toy applications that provide example implementations of using internationalisation in those languages.</p> <p>Showing that text changes on a screen as a result of a language setting changing is their key functionality, and this is reflected in how the tests are written.</p> <p>For a real application containing many translated text entries in different locations in multiple languages, the string-based testing used in these test suites is not really feasible. The burden of having to update tests whenever translations are updated will get tiresome quickly; translations and tests are best being able to change independent of each other.</p> <p>Instead, it is much more helpful to have some kind of external tool that can run over your codebase and translation files to inform you on whether:</p> <ul> <li>you have any missing translations in certain languages</li> <li>you have translations for strings that are not referenced in the application anymore (ie they are obsolete)</li> </ul> <p>My favourite local developer tool I have used in the past to do this has actually been a <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> gem, <a href="https://glebm.github.io/i18n-tasks/">i18n-tasks</a>. If you do <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> development with internationalisation, definitely add it to your toolbox.</p> <p>There does not seem to be quite as robust a tool in the Phoenix or Elm ecosystems as of this writing, but there are other options available.</p> <p>For a Phoenix application, it would seem that you can “verify that your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext#Programming">POT files</a> are up to date with the current state of the codebase” with a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gettext/Mix.Tasks.Gettext.Extract.html#content"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mix gettext.extract</code></a> task:</p> <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mix gettext.extract <span class="nt">--check-up-to-date</span>

I am just a stenography enthusiast who learned about the concept of Q&amp;A while studying <a href="https://platinumsteno.com/">Platinum Steno</a>’s (PS) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85Y9t9lANyArY9uTBE_kmy2cT_ECSHvU">video theory lessons</a> (more about that in my other blog post, <em><a href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/going-platinum/">Going Platinum</a></em>), and what is presented here is just my interpretation of what I discovered. Consequently, there is definitely a chance that I have gotten some things wrong, and if I have, please reach out via public comment below, or to me directly.</p> <p>Plover theory itself does not contain any <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/learnplover/glossary">outlines</a> related to Q&amp;A like the ones that would seem to be contained in PS’s custom software, and are taught in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEgaJ7hWIvg&amp;list=PL85Y9t9lANyArY9uTBE_kmy2cT_ECSHvU&amp;index=61">Q&amp;A lessons</a>. So, in order to actively engage in those lessons, I wondered if I could attempt to recreate PS’s Q&amp;A outline entries (including their formatting conventions and rules, which may be specific to them, and differ between courts in different hierarchies/states/jurisdictions/countries etc) in a custom dictionary that would work with Plover.</p> <p>I think I was able to, and have presented the result <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_bono">pro bono publico</a></em> in the form of:</p> <p>:sparkles: <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/steno_dictionaries/blob/main/dictionaries/q-and-a.json">My custom Q&amp;A dictionary</a> :sparkles:</p> <p>Feel free to incorporate it into your own Plover dictionaries and give the Q&amp;A lessons a shot, or just use it to follow along with the examples in this post!</p> <p>Armed with a dictionary to use, let’s learn how to use it, while getting an introduction to Q&amp;A itself!</p> <h2 id="ab-initio"><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio">Ab Initio</a></em></h2> <p>There are, broadly, two different types of Q&amp;A testing:</p> <ul> <li><strong>2-Voice</strong>: an interrogative conversation between two participants: a lawyer and a witness. The lawyer can be either for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff">plaintiff</a>/prosecution, or for the defense, but this detail is usually not relevant to the scope of the conversation.</li> <li><strong>4-Voice</strong>: a cross-examination involving lawyers from each opposing party, a witness, and the courtroom judge. Handling multiple lawyers in either party is possible, so it can technically be “4-to-6-Voice”, but there are typically only four participants.</li> </ul> <p>2-Voice transcripts typically read like a simple back-and-forth question and answer session, while 4-Voice builds on this by including added complexity like:</p> <ul> <li>marking a lawyer’s “ownership” of a line of questioning</li> <li>transcribing objections raised by lawyers, and subsequent guidance by the judge</li> <li>specific transcribing conventions for when interruptions occur during a lawyer’s line of questioning, causing it to veer off its original path, and then the subsequent “steering” of the record back to original line of questioning once the detour has ended</li> </ul> <p>We will start off with a deep dive into using Plover for 2-Voice, and then up ante with 4-Voice.</p> <h2 id="2-voice">2-Voice</h2> <div class="plover-for-the-record-image"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2021-09-04/phoenix-and-maya.jpg" alt="Phoenix Wright and Maya cosplay"/> <figcaption> Photo by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/vivienovo"> VivianOVO </a> on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/vivienovo/art/Ace-Attorney-Maya-Fey-347872629"> Deviant Art </a> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>During Q&amp;A, whenever someone starts speaking, you indicate this by “signing them in”, either by name, or marking them as the asker or answerer of a question.</p> <p>For 2-Voice, names are not important, and we only care about marking the question and its answer. Questioners and answerers are “signed in” using special outlines known as question and answer “banks”, which PS defines as follows:</p> <table class="steno-table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Stroke</th> <th class="centered-heading">Outline</th> <th class="centered-heading">Keymap</th> </tr> </thead> <tr> <td>Question Bank</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STKPWHR</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STKPWHR</span> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Answer Bank</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> </tr> </table> <p>These outlines, like nearly all Q&amp;A-related outlines, are not meant to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics">phonetic</a> (indicative of how the word sounds), nor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography">orthographic</a> (indicative of how the word is spelled). So, I find it easiest to remember their form, or pattern, kind of like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> blocks. Hence, I would wager the rectangular chunks here are meant to evoke an image of land masses along the side of the middle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>-key river that divides them.</p> <p>Using these outlines, a simple question and answer could display as something like the following:</p> <p class="steno-transcript"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were you on the night of January 16?<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at home, practicing steno. </p> <p>This formatting obeys the following rules:</p> <ul> <li>Questions are marked with a simple “<span class="steno-transcript">Q</span>”, and answers with an “<span class="steno-transcript">A</span>” (no following colons or periods)</li> <li><span class="steno-transcript">Q</span> and <span class="steno-transcript">A</span> have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key">tab</a> character on either side of them</li> <li>Both questions and answers start with capital letters</li> </ul> <p>Court transcripts would seem to be written using a <span class="steno-transcript"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font">monospaced font</a></span>, so we will adopt that convention as well, using the widely-available <span class="steno-transcript">Courier New</span> font.</p> <h3 id="ending-punctuation">Ending Punctuation</h3> <p>The one thing that is not apparent just by looking at the example above is the convention around a speaker’s <em>final sentence</em> punctuation before another speaker starts talking.</p> <p>Apparently, in Q&amp;A, the addition of an ending question mark (<span class="steno-transcript">?</span>) or period (<span class="steno-transcript">.</span>) to the <em>final sentence</em> spoken before the speaker changes is meant to be handled by the outline that signs in the next speaker.</p> <p>For example, when you switch from a question to an answer by stroking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-FRPBLGTS</code>, that outline is expected to:</p> <ul> <li>Finish the question with a “<span class="steno-transcript">?</span>”</li> <li>Perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">line break</a></li> <li>insert a tab</li> <li>type <span class="steno-transcript">A</span></li> <li>insert another tab</li> <li>make sure the next word will start with a capital letter</li> </ul> <p>The rule is the same when switching from an answer back to a question, but with an ending “<span class="steno-transcript">.</span>” and a beginning <span class="steno-transcript">Q</span>.</p> <p>Regarding this ending punctuation rule, PS says that the (presumably custom) software they use on their steno machines makes some kind of automatic determination about whether a question was asked or an answer given, and adds in appropriate question/answer punctuation as it deems appropriate.</p> <p>PS does say that this determination is not perfect, and hence you may end up with question marks at the end of answers, or periods that the end of questions (which may be correct for the sentence sometimes since lawyers can make statements, and witnesses can ask questions). The workaround to this issue, it would seem, is to just fix the punctuation <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc">post-hoc</a></em> when you proofread your transcript.</p> <p>Plover itself has no built-in knowledge of any kind of “Q&amp;A-related ending punctuation automatic determination functionality”, so I attempted to mostly replicate the PS software logic into my custom Q&amp;A dictionary, but also make a few quality-of-life improvements. The aim was to provide sensible defaults for ending punctuation, but also allow for manual overriding for when you want to explicitly specify what they should be.</p> <p>With that in mind, here is a set of outlines I came up with to perform 2-Voice in a more flexible way:</p> <table class="steno-table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Stroke</th> <th class="centered-heading">Outline</th> <th class="centered-heading">Keymap</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tr> <td>Default Question Bank</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STKPWHR</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STKPWHR</span> </td> <td> Ends previous witness sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">.</span>" </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Initial Question Bank</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STKPWHR*</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STKPWHR*</span> </td> <td> Question is the first line of transcript; no previous sentence punctuation needed. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Question Bank following question</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STKPWHR-F</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STKPWHR-F</span> </td> <td> Ends previous witness sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">?</span>", for when witness asks a question. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interrupting Question Bank</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STKPWHR-RB</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STKPWHR-RB</span> </td> <td> Ends previous witness sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">--</span>" for when lawyer interrupts witness. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Question Bank following statement</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STKPWHR-R</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STKPWHR-R</span> </td> <td> Ends previous witness sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">.</span>" (same as Default Question Bank, added for completeness' sake) </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Default Answer Bank</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Ends previous lawyer sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">?</span>" </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Answer Bank following statement</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>R-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>R-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">.</span>", for when lawyer makes a statement. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interrupting Answer Bank</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>WR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>WR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">--</span>" for when witness interrupts lawyer. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Answer Bank following question</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>H-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>H-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">?</span>" (same as Default Answer Bank, added for completeness' sake) </td> </tr> </table> <p>Some further notes on this set of outlines:</p> <ul> <li>In Q&amp;A, sentences would seem to only ever end in question marks, periods, or dashes. No exclamation marks, or any other type of punctuation, would seem to be used, so I did not create any outlines using them</li> <li>I chose the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">H-</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-F</code> keys to delineate ending questions since they are on the higher steno row, indicating the typical upward voice inflection of a spoken question, and vice versa for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R-</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-R</code> keys for statements</li> <li>I chose <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-RB</code> for an ending dash as it marks the “sh” sound in the Plover “dash” outline (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TK-RB</code>), and use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WR-</code> is just a mirror reflection of that</li> <li>No Initial Answer Bank outline was created since it would seem that there are never answers given without a question in Q&amp;A</li> <li> <p>If you are following along with <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/steno_dictionaries/blob/main/dictionaries/q-and-a.json">my custom Q&amp;A dictionary</a>, you may notice that tabs and newline characters in the entries use the special <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\t</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\n</code> characters, rather than <a href="https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Dictionary-Format#keyboard-shortcuts">Plover keyboard shortcuts</a> like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#tab}</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#return}</code>. For example, the entry for the Default Question Bank:</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"STKPWHR": "{.}{^\n\t^}{^Q^}{^\t^}{-|}"</code></p> <p>This is done simply to enable undoing the entire entry in one keystroke. Using Plover keyboard shortcuts makes what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> key can undo significantly less predictable.</p> <p>More details about the reasons behind this can be found in Plover’s documentation on <a href="https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Dictionary-Format#undoable-line-breaks-and-tabs">Undoable Line Breaks and Tabs</a>, and more details about all those other characters in the entry can be found in <a href="https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Dictionary-Format">Plover’s Dictionary Format</a> documentation.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="2-voice-demos">2-Voice Demos</h3> <p>In order to show my Q&amp;A dictionary in action, I have recorded a few videos of myself attempting to transcribe some of PS’s initial Q&amp;A lessons. Don’t expect stellar steno speeds (or much competence at all) in the videos below as I am still learning :sweat_smile:</p> <p>The letters on the light board behind the instructor indicate who is currently speaking:</p> <ul> <li><strong>P</strong>: Plaintiff/Prosecution</li> <li><strong>W</strong>: Witness</li> <li><strong>C</strong>: The Court (the Judge)</li> <li><strong>D</strong>: Defense</li> </ul> <p>There will be more variation in these lights once we get into 4-Voice.</p> <p>The following video is of PS’s very first Q&amp;A lesson, so the conversation is quite straightforward and slow. One thing to note, though, is that it begins with the questioner making a statement, necessitating use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R-FRPBLGTS</code> outline.</p> <div class="steno-video"> <div class="responsive-video-container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xpJNxsOjFZs" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <figcaption> Transcript: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JymsW65Q2joKCSJxNd5HS4mOX6TznrN77fGRnJKrM6o/edit?usp=sharing"> Platinum Steno Theory Lesson 27 Q&amp;A #1 </a> </figcaption> </div> <blockquote> <p>See <a href="#appendix-a-formatting-the-record">Appendix A: Formatting the Record</a> for how I set up <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> to produce official-looking(?) court transcripts.</p> </blockquote> <p>This next video is more of the same, but note that when the witness is asked to spell their name, a technique called “stitching” is used.

STPHAO</span>, the output of the lawyer outlines can be considered placeholders. Before a Q&amp;A exercise starts, if you are given the lawyer names, you can just do a simple text find-and-replace in the Q&amp;A dictionary to change <span class="steno-transcript">MR. STPHAO</span> to <span class="steno-transcript">MS. WEXLER</span> etc where appropriate. The outlines for the judge and witness are never given specific names</li> <li>The formatting for the output of all of these outlines is uppercase. What is not shown above, but will be shown in an extract below, is that a tab is output before the name, and then a colon and a space is output following the name</li> <li>Plover theory has already assigned the word “irks” to Defense Lawyer 2’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EURBGS</code> outline. So, <em><a href="https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/caveat-utilitor">Caveat Utilitor</a></em> that if you use the Q&amp;A outline, you will be mildly inconvenienced by needing to stroke the word “irks” as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EURBG/-S</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EURBG/-Z</code></li> <li>PS’s witness outline of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W-PBS/W-PBS</code> felt a bit awkward to me, given the shapes of the other outlines, and having to stroke the same outline twice. The “lower row version” of The Court outline, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SKWRAOEURBGS</code>, was not assigned to anything in Plover, so it made sense to me to assign it to the witness: the judge sits on the “high” bench, and the witness sits in the “low” dock. Both sets of outlines are included in the custom Q&amp;A dictionary, so feel free to use whichever outline works for you</li> <li>Like the question and answer bank outlines, each outlines above comes with a set of variations that marks it as the first line of the transcript, or ends the previous sentence with a period, question mark, or dash. Check out the custom dictionary itself for all those details</li> </ul> <p>This is quite a lot to take in, so let’s have a look at an example that uses the new outlines above, the question/answer ones we have already seen, and one we will have a look at later:</p> <p class="steno-transcript"> BY MR. CHAMBERS:<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Miss Smith, where do you currently live?<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1892 Spring Drive in Riverside.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you live at that address in July of 2018?<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, sir.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MR. DUGO: Your Honor, I am having a difficult time hearing the witness.<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE COURT: Miss Smith, I know it is tough, but have got to keep your voice up a little bit. It is hard to hear in this courtroom, okay?<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE WITNESS: Yes, your Honor. </p> <ul> <li>The first line, <span class="steno-transcript">BY MR. CHAMBERS</span>, is a byline, and indicates that the lawyer Mr. Chambers is in charge of, or owns, the current line of questioning: his questions are marked by <span class="steno-transcript">Q</span> and the witness’s answers are marked by <span class="steno-transcript">A</span>. We will look more at bylines next up</li> <li>The next few lines are standard Q&amp;A that we have seen before, which use the question and answer bank outlines</li> <li>On line 6, the opposing lawyer, Mr. Dugo, interrupts the line of questioning. Mr. Dugo does not own the line of questioning, so he does not get a byline, but instead his statement is recorded inline. From this point, we have veered off the current line of questioning</li> <li>On line 7, the judge addresses the witness, with the question also recorded inline</li> <li>On line 8, the witness answers the question. An answer sign-in using <span class="steno-transcript">A</span> only occurs when the witness answers a question posed by the lawyer who owns the current line of questioning. Since the witness is answering the judge’s question, and not a question posed by Mr. Chambers, it is recorded inline as <span class="steno-transcript">THE WITNESS</span>. Whenever a witness talks out of turn without being asked a question, or is not directing an answer at the lawyer who owns the line of questioning (like at the judge here, or at the opposing lawyer), witness statements are recorded in this way</li> </ul> <h3 id="bylines">Bylines</h3> <div class="plover-for-the-record-image" style="width: 70%;"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2021-09-04/briefcase-battle.jpg" alt="Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth briefcase battle cosplay"/> <figcaption> Photo by <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/kazzu"> KaZzu </a> on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/kazzu/art/Briefcase-Battle-80339570"> Deviant Art </a> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>Bylines are used to indicate the lawyer that owns, or is in charge of, the current line of questioning to a witness. The outline that signs in a lawyer outputs in the following format:</p> <p class="steno-transcript"> BY &lt;TITLE&gt;. &lt;SURNAME&gt;:<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;cursor&gt; </p> <p>It would seem that the convention is to output the lawyer’s title and surname, all in capital letters, and then output a question bank to kick off cross-examination. Like specific naming in outlines mentioned earlier, witnesses and judges also do not get bylines.</p> <p>Whenever the lawyer begins questioning, they are signed in with a byline. If they finish questioning, and a lawyer from the opposing legal team begins questioning, they are signed in separately. If, as you saw in the transcript above, a line of questioning is interrupted, when it re-begins again, the same lawyer gets re-signed in.</p> <p>Here is a set of outlines that can be used for the bylines of Plaintiff Lawyer 1 and Defense Lawyer 1 (check the custom Q&amp;A dictionary for details of the other lawyers, but they follow the same pattern):</p> <table class="steno-table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Stroke</th> <th class="centered-heading">Outline</th> <th class="centered-heading">Keymap</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tr> <td>Plaintiff Lawyer 1 Initial Byline</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STPHAO*</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STPHAO*</span> </td> <td> Byline is the first line of transcript; no previous sentence punctuation needed. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Plaintiff Lawyer 1 Byline following question</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STPHAO*F</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STPHAO*F</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">?</span>" </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Plaintiff Lawyer 1 Byline following statement</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STPHAO*R</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STPHAO*R</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">.</span>" </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Plaintiff Lawyer 1 Byline following interruption</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STPHAO*RB</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STPHAO*RB</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">--</span>" </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Defense Lawyer 1 Initial Byline</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td> Byline is the first line of transcript; no previous sentence punctuation needed. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Defense Lawyer 1 Byline following question</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>H*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>H*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">?</span>" </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Defense Lawyer 1 Byline following statement</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>R*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>R*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">.</span>" </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Defense Lawyer 1 Byline following interruption</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>WR*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>WR*EUFPLT</span> </td> <td> Ends previous sentence with "<span class="steno-transcript">--</span>" </td> </tr> </table> <h2 id="4-voice-demos">4-Voice Demos</h2> <p>Now that you have been formally introduced to the cast of characters in our courtroom drama, and how they interact with each other, let’s see how that all plays out in some video demos.</p> <p>The first demo shows a basic 4-Voice example using the lawyer name placeholders. Typically, you are given the lawyer names before beginning Q&amp;A so you can substitute them in.</p> <p>Note the switching of bylines as each lawyer begins and ends their lines of questioning. Also note that when the lawyers indicate that they have no further questions, since that statement is not a question directed at the witness, it is not transcribed with a <span class="steno-transcript">Q</span>, but as a named statement under their own byline.</p> <div class="steno-video"> <div class="responsive-video-container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vdQXdKy0im8" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <figcaption> Transcript: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggOzm94IAh5IRKLo14qdsvLnCHoBXoislsZitnF4xEQ/edit?usp=sharing"> Platinum Steno Theory Lesson 31 Q&amp;A #5 </a> </figcaption> </div> <p>The next video is more of the same, but actually using human names for the lawyers.</p> <div class="steno-video"> <div class="responsive-video-container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ccxfO0W96wA" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <figcaption> Transcript: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gcfaP6JoHuu5u08zlapQqnDLA0aASk3iazaLQX0Rqko/edit?usp=sharing"> Platinum Steno Theory Lesson 32 Q&amp;A #6 </a> </figcaption> </div> <h2 id="adjournment-sine-die"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjournment_sine_die">Adjournment <em>sine die</em></a></h2> <p>There is more to learn about Q&amp;A than I have been able to cover here, so if you are interested in delving even deeper, I would highly recommend checking out the following videos specifically from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL85Y9t9lANyArY9uTBE_kmy2cT_ECSHvU">Platinum Steno Theory playlist</a>:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEgaJ7hWIvg&amp;list=PL85Y9t9lANyArY9uTBE_kmy2cT_ECSHvU&amp;index=61">Lesson 27 QA</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABd5JcmOmg0&amp;list=PL85Y9t9lANyArY9uTBE_kmy2cT_ECSHvU&amp;index=70">Lesson 31</a></li> </ul> <p>The entire set of theory lessons is great, but if you want more information specifically on Q&amp;A, then I think these are the main two you want to watch.</p> <p>Even if you are not planning on becoming a court reporter, I think that doing these kinds of Q&amp;A exercises is great dictation practice in general, and I can see the ability to be able to manage conversation threads being applicable to captioning other kinds of conversational interactions: re-assign the outlines for lawyers, the judge, and the witness to panelists, an adjudicator, and the audience, and you can now transcribe a debate!</p> <p>If you end up giving it a try, and perhaps improve on the methods outlined here, be sure to reach out!</p> <blockquote> <p>Wondering where that cool steno keyboard font came from?

I did.” (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ymmv">YMMV</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p>Given the examples above, here is the set of new outlines that I added to <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/steno_dictionaries/blob/main/dictionaries/q-and-a.json">my custom Q&amp;A dictionary</a> for use with a witness:</p> <table class="steno-table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Stroke</th> <th class="centered-heading">Outline</th> <th class="centered-heading">Keymap</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tr> <td>"Yes." and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>KWR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>KWR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from the <code>KWR</code> outline for the letter "Y" for "yes", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Yes, sir." and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>SKWR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>SKWR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from <code>KWR</code> with an inverted <code>S</code> to make <code>YS</code> for "yes, sir", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Yeah." and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>KWREFRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>KWREFRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from Plover's <code>KWR*E</code> outline for "yeah", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Correct." and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>KR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>KR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from Plover's <code>KREBGT</code> outline for "correct", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Right." and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>TR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>TR-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from a truncated and inverted version of Plover's <code>RAOEUT</code> outline for "right", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Sure." and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>SH-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>SH-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from a truncated version of Plover's <code>SHUR</code> outline for "sure", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"Uh-huh." and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>HUFRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>HUFRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Awkwardly derived from Plover's <code>*U/H*U</code> outline for "uh-huh", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"No.", and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>TPH-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>TPH-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from the <code>TPH</code> outline for the letter "N" for "no", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"No, sir.", and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>STPH-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>STPH-FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived from <code>TPH</code> with an inverted <code>S</code> to make <code>NS</code> for "no, sir", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"I don't know.", and elaborate</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>KWROEFRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>KWROEFRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> Derived partly from Plover's <code>KWROEPB</code> outline for "I don't know", then the answer bank. </td> </tr> </table> <p>Sometimes, the statements above are the only thing a witness says before the lawyer begins the next question.</p> <p>Therefore, I have also added complementary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>-flagged outlines for each of the examples above that instantly yield control back to the questioner once the answer has been given, and output a new <span class="steno-transcript">Q</span>.</p> <p>Here is a sample:</p> <table class="steno-table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Stroke</th> <th class="centered-heading">Outline</th> <th class="centered-heading">Keymap</th> <th>Notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tr> <td>"Yes." and yield control</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>KWR*FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>KWR*FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> <code>*</code>-flagged version of <code>KWR-FRPBLGTS</code>. </td> </tr> <tr> <td>"No.", and yield control</td> <td class="steno-outline"> <span>TPH*FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td class="steno-font"> <span>TPH*FRPBLGTS</span> </td> <td> <code>*</code>-flagged version of <code>TPH-FRPBLGTS</code>. </td> </tr> </table> <p>See the Q&amp;A dictionary file for full set.</p> <h3 id="lawyers">Lawyers</h3> <p>For lawyers, things are a bit simpler.

</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>A few notes about these entries:</p> <ul> <li>Yes, there is already an outline for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{&amp;a-}</code>, but I wanted one that followed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-PLT</code> pattern like the rest. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">APLT</code> was already taken for “amount”, so I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A*EUPLT</code> with the long “a” sound instead</li> <li>For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{&amp;i-}</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{&amp;u-}</code>, I wanted to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EUPLT</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UPLT</code>, but they were also already taken for “implement” and “ultimate”, respectively, so they, too, got elongated vowel versions of the outlines I originally wanted</li> </ul> <p>That still leaves <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{&amp;f-}</code> missing, though. The outline I wanted to use was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TP-PLT</code>, to match the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-PLT</code> pattern of the other stitching outlines, but it was already reserved for the period (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{.}</code>). Now, Plover already assigns 32(!) outlines to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{.}</code>, so, I figured it wouldn’t miss the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TP-PLT</code> outline if I overrode it and gave it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{&amp;f-}</code>.</p> <p>This ended up being the catalyst to create my <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/steno_dictionaries/blob/7191ce5a00/dictionaries/overrides/briefs.json">custom brief overrides dictionary</a>, for cases where I have a difference of opinion from Plover’s outline allocation, and want to assign an outline to some other word.</p> <p>For good measure, I also snuck in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"AO*EPLT": "{&amp;e-}"</code> to the overrides dictionary, just to make sure that <em>all</em> stitching entries would follow the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-PLT</code> pattern. Plover assigns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AO*EPLT</code> to “empty”, but since I do not associate the word “empty” with a long “e”, I was happy to re-assign the outline.</p> <h3 id="flipping-the-script">Flipping the Script</h3> <p>After using the stitching outlines above for a little while, I came across the following issue: whenever a speaker finished spelling their name, I would be left with a trailing hyphen (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code>) that I would have to manually delete. In some cases, it was just not possible to know in advance what the final letter of a name would be until it was said, and it would be too late to switch out the final letter with a standard fingerspelled letter.</p> <p>When it comes to spelling spoken words, we definitely know when the beginning is, but not necessarily when the end will be. So, I thought perhaps the stitching outlines could work in the same way: use a fingerspelled letter for the first letter, and use <em>backwards</em>-hyphened stitching for the rest of the letters, allowing a stitched word to finish at any time.</p> <p>So, I came up with the following set of outlines that use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*PLT</code> suffix, which are spread across my custom stitching and brief overrides dictionaries, but are presented here as a single set for ease of viewing:</p> <div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

So, I would like to spread the word about these great lessons, but also provide some commentary, from the point of view of a hobbyist, about where I think they best fit in a steno learner’s itinerary.</p> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <p>Platinum Steno (PS) is (was?) a provider of paid educational and training material for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_reporter">court reporters</a>. In February 2021, they released their entire catalogue of stenography theory and speed-building videos to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/platinumsteno">their YouTube channel</a>, and made the complementary lesson materials and worksheets freely available to download from their website (though you do need to go through a checkout process for $0 to get each lesson’s materials).</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/platinumsteno/posts/1390445521301220">This post</a> on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/platinumsteno">their Facebook page</a> would seem to explain some of the motivations for making their content widely available:</p> <blockquote> <p>This content should not be used to replace your existing school or program. Our intention in releasing this content was never to compete with existing programs. We decided to release this material because we felt that everyone could benefit from it, especially if it was free to the students. […] No matter where you are in your journey, we believe the content is valuable and can have a place in your practice sessions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Being a computer programmer that loves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">open-source software</a>, and whose steno theory of choice is the free and open <a href="http://www.openstenoproject.org/">Plover</a> theory, I love this sentiment and can definitely get behind it! With regards to being able to use the content “no matter where you are in your journey”, though, I think there are a few caveats here that are worth making more explicit.</p> <h2 id="open-content-closed-theory">Open Content, Closed Theory</h2> <p>From what I understand from conversations on the <a href="https://discord.me/plover">Plover Discord</a>, the PS theory lessons use a “modified <a href="https://www.stenedsource.com/">StenEd</a>” theory (Plover also <a href="https://www.artofchording.com/introduction/theories-and-dictionaries.html#plover-theory">“has its roots in StenEd”</a>, so there is some overlap between it and PS).</p> <p>Looking on the StenEd website, you can see that there are lots of options to buy various books and audio material. If you are a beginner, and just want to try steno before making any big monetary investments, you may think you could bypass these purchases for now, and just start learning via the YouTube videos.</p> <p>However, you now have some new questions:</p> <ul> <li>Where will you get the StenEd dictionaries that map the steno outlines you find in PS’s worksheets to their English words? PS’s “modified” theory would seem to indicate there is a level of customisation to their dictionaries that would be unique to them (and hence may not be in any “official” StenEd dictionaries you could buy), and those dictionaries do not seem to have been released alongside their video lessons.</li> <li>Where will you get the software that will translate your chorded StenEd keyboard strokes into English output? The lessons make mention of special, presumably also custom, software, which, along with chord translation, handles specific situations like chording large numbers, currency, and legal Q&amp;A exercises (more about that later); this software also does not seem to have been released publicly.</li> <li>Even if you did find that software, will it run on your computer, or do you need an expensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype#Modern_hardware">stenotype machine</a> to run it?</li> </ul> <p>If you have made the plunge to formally enrol in a steno school which uses StenEd theory, then perhaps all of the issues outlined above are irrelevant, and you can, indeed, easily augment your studies with PS’s materials. This is fantastic! Definitely go for it (and feel free to ignore most of the rest of this post)!</p> <h2 id="delayed-gratification">Delayed Gratification</h2> <p>If you are going to go the open and free route with learning steno as a beginner, then Plover theory is currently your only viable choice. This is not a bad thing (I :heart: Plover!), and I think the theory that the PS lessons use is not really important compared to the value provided by their content.</p> <p>Although Plover theory and <a href="https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/releases">its software</a>, can enable you to attempt the lessons without any upfront monetary cost (assuming you already have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)#n-key_rollover"><em>N</em>-Key Rollover</a>-compatible keyboard), I believe a cost is borne in the <em>timing</em> that you can reasonably start studying them, which is not at the very beginning of your steno journey.</p> <p>Therefore, I would suggest <em>forgetting</em> PS for now, and instead focus on just learning Plover theory, to the point where you understand it intuitively.</p> <p>Read one or both of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/learnplover/">Learn Plover!</a> and <a href="https://www.artofchording.com/">Art of Chording</a> (both recommended!), and get <em>lots</em> of steno practice in using applications like <a href="https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/">Typey Type</a>, or any one of the many resources listed on <a href="https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover/wiki/Learning-Stenography">Plover’s Learning Resources Wiki page</a>.</p> <p>This will probably take you a few months at the very least, so go off and have fun learning! The rest of this post will happily wait for your return…</p> <div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; width: 90%;"> <figure style="display: block"> <img src="/assets/images/2021-07-12/scott-webb-habqOl7e_S8-unsplash.jpg" alt="woman looking on trees"/> <figcaption style="text-align: center;"> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@scottwebb?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Scott Webb </a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/platinum?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash </a> </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>…Welcome back! You now have a high degree of fluency in Plover, and have had lots of practice chording keystrokes, right? Great! Time to re-consider looking at PS theory lessons!</p> <p>Wait, I’m recommending that you go <em>back</em> to theory? Didn’t you do all that already? Yes, you did! The core steno theory concepts in PS will end up just being revision for you, and the fact that they use StenEd theory will now not be a cause for any potential confusion thanks to your solid foundation in Plover! So, you will be able to focus more on the content that the PS theory lessons provide that I think is unique to them.</p> <h2 id="platinum-club-benefits">Platinum Club Benefits</h2> <p>The most important elements in determining the success of any educational courses are its delivery and content, and PS excels in both of these areas.</p> <h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3> <p>Jill Paxton-Brumund, the teacher of the theory lessons, is absolutely fantastic!</p> <p>Jill’s kind-yet-no-nonsense approach made learning with her a pleasure. Her explanations of steno outlines, stories from the trenches of court reporting, and even the way she read dictation exercises to prompt you to recognise when you could use a stroke-saving brief, were all massively helpful and interesting.</p> <p>Learning steno is hard, and can be a grind, and Jill is unapologetic in telling you that if you are having trouble learning or remembering outlines, or chording particular keystrokes, to just go back and re-practice things multiple times until they sink in.</p> <p>I felt like Jill was my steno gym coach, encouraging me to do those extra repetitions to build up muscle memory, and rooting for me to succeed. Thank you, Jill!</p> <h3 id="content">Content</h3> <p>During the course of the lessons, I definitely got some value out of doing more in-depth revision of core steno concepts. More importantly, though, the lessons served as motivation for creating my own learning materials, and broadening my knowledge of steno:</p> <ul> <li>The lessons contained a lot of vocabulary, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_and_common_nouns">proper nouns</a>, that I had not encountered in Plover learning materials, and in some cases were not contained in the default Plover dictionary. This became the catalyst for the creation of <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/steno_dictionaries">my personal dictionaries</a>: to augment what Plover provided with outlines that made sense to me.<br/> I would either take outlines directly from the PS lessons that I liked and put them in my dictionaries, or just make up outlines for new words that felt “Plover-esque” to me (doing Plover theory first helped me gain the intuition and confidence to do that).</li> <li> <p>As I went through each lesson, I took the time to annotate each of the vocabulary outlines on the PS written materials with the Plover equivalents which blew out the time to finish each lesson significantly for me (feel free to do this mentally if you wish…). Sometimes, the outlines for StenEd and Plover would be the same, but when they were not, I used the following note style:</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2021-07-12/theory-edits.jpg" alt="img theory-edits" style="width: 50%;"/></p> <ol> <li>An outline written as-is under a word would signify that the PS outline <em>cannot</em> be used in Plover, and the new outline must be used. In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PWUT/ER</code> is not a valid outline for “butter” in Plover theory, so I chose my preferred Plover outline to put here: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PWAOURT</code> (though the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>-flagged <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PWUT/*ER</code> <em>is</em> valid in Plover).</li> <li>An outline written in parentheses, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">()</code>, indicates that the PS outline is valid in Plover, but I personally prefer a different one. In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TKEUPB/ER</code> also maps to “dinner” in Plover theory, but I prefer the single-stroke <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TKEURPB</code>.</li> <li>An outline written in square-brackets, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[]</code>, indicates that the actual word does not exist in the default Plover dictionary, and so a custom outline was required to be created. As of this writing, Plover has no entry for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobermann">Doberman</a>”, and although I could have used the provided <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TKOEB/ER/PHAPB</code> outline since it looks reasonable, I decided to create a new one to shave off a stroke: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TKOERB/PHAPB</code>.</li> </ol> </li> <li>There is a lot of emphasis in the PS lessons on being able to stroke basic multi-word briefs with a single chord (eg “I have”, “did you”, “that he was”, “do you have the” etc). As well as building muscle memory in areas that will assist in getting higher speeds, this led to the addition of over 150 new phrase briefs to my personal dictionaries, so I hope they’ll serve me well (and maybe even you?) in the future.</li> <li>I learned about the concept of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEgaJ7hWIvg">Q&amp;A</a>, which took the form of dictation exercises involving legal cross-examination of witnesses by attorneys in a courtroom setting.<br/> I am not training to be a court reporter, but I had fun learning all about the conventions around writing up a legal record, including the formatting, how to “check in” attorneys with “by-lines” before they start questioning a witness, and just how the documentation of various participants in a conversation occurs (I have no idea how much commonality there is between different types of courts around the English-speaking world for legal record writing conventions).<br/> If, like me, you think of learning steno like learning another language, I think that the Q&amp;A parts of the PS lessons could be considered their “cultural studies”. You will rarely learn a human language in isolation from all the cultural elements that helped form and shape it, and I believe this to be the case with Q&amp;A as well, given steno’s long history with the legal profession.<br/> I also made a <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/steno_dictionaries/blob/main/dictionaries/q-and-a.json">Q&amp;A dictionary</a> that, I believe, can help Plover mimic the software that PS uses for this. Hopefully it can be of assistance to any Plover users who also decide to learn some Q&amp;A!<br/> <strong>UPDATE 3 Oct 2021</strong>: I wrote in-depth about doing Q&amp;A with Plover in another blog post, <em><a href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/plover-for-the-record/">Plover for the Record</a></em>.</li> </ul> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>If you are a Plover steno learner looking for more educational materials after working your way through other community-created texts, then you cannot go wrong with PS’s theory lessons, especially given that there is now no barrier to entry.</p> <p>Personally, I am still on the PS bandwagon, and have started going through their speed classes, starting at 60 words-per-minute. It is tough, even now, but I consider it to be just another stage of the marathon I am happily running as part of my steno journey.</p> <p>Thanks to Platinum Steno for providing such a great cache of material to budding learners of stenography, and I look forward to being able to gradually improve past my QWERTY speeds, and beyond!</p>]]></content><author><name>Paul Fioravanti</name><email>paul@paulfioravanti.com</email><uri>https://www.paulfioravanti.com</uri></author><category term="plover"/><category term="stenography"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[New to stenography and wondering if you should do the Platinum Steno theory courses?

I find I nearly always learn something new, or a different way of doing something I may already know, that makes me re-think the way I have solved a problem.</p> <p>In this instance, a friend sent me <a href="https://www.sentia.com.au/">Sentia</a>’s coding test to check out, and simply because I felt like I had not begun a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application from scratch in a long time, I decided to take a crack at it.

id="elephant">:elephant:</h2> <p>First thing’s first: let’s address the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room">elephant in the requirements</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>This application can be built in 1 hour.</p> </blockquote> <p>If this is true, then I am a <strong><em>terrible</em></strong> developer.</p> <p>It took me a fair bit longer than that to write working code as-per requirements, debug the requirements (more on that later…), get it deployed somewhere on the internet, and refactor the code to a state where I would be happy to submit it for public consumption and criticism (I was <em>still</em> refactoring it while writing this post).</p> <p>If the intention is for someone to complete as many of the requirements as they can <em>within</em> that fixed 1 hour time frame, with the end result considered through the lens of that artificial constraint, then that should be made explicit.</p> <p>Regardless, I think it would probably be for the best to just remove that line, and allow candidates attempting this test to just focus on submitting their best attempt, and keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">imposter syndrome</a> at bay for that little bit longer.</p> <h2 id="general-approach">General Approach</h2> <p>Since the requirements around this application focus on it being a Ruby on Rails application, I decided to go as “vanilla” as possible with Rails.</p> <p>This meant no explicit addition by me of any custom <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, or any front-end frameworks that use it, to help out with things like filtering or sorting information.</p> <p>I also tried to add the least amount of third-party non-Rails-default gems as possible, only using:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/alassek/activerecord-pg_enum">ActiveRecord::PGEnum</a>, due to its nice developer ergonomics in dealing with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-enum.html">Postgres Enumerated Types</a> (more about why they were even needed later…)</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/drapergem/draper">Draper</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decorators</a>: I really do not like using <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Helpers.html">Rails helpers</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_logic">presentation logic</a>, preferring instead to keep it attached to the object being rendered; raw data can come from the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html">Rails model</a> class, while transforming that data for display in a <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html">Rails view</a> can come from a decorator</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari">Kaminari</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination">pagination</a>, as I think it is currently the best gem for it</li> </ul> <h2 id="user-interface">User Interface</h2> <p>Since interface design and making things pretty in general is a weak-point for me, I used this test as an excuse to give <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> a try in order to style everything on the page (I have used <a href="https://tachyons.io/">Tachyons</a> before on other toy projects, so I am generally positive to the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first">utility-first CSS</a> concept), as well as use <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> to (hopefully) grab ready-made code for certain types of components.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2021-05-09/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot"/></p> <p>For the most part, this was true for the following parts of the app:</p> <ul> <li>data table</li> <li>upload button</li> <li>search bar</li> <li>pagination widget</li> </ul> <p>But, as would be expected, it was not all quite as simple as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_and_play">plug and play</a>. Integrating Tailwind into the Kaminari-generated pagination views probably took the most amount of time. But, I got there in the end, and am generally pleased with how it looks for the time spent on it.</p> <p>For the most part, I left any long Tailwind-mnemonic-filled class strings as they were in the Rails view files. However, when those strings became too long, and generally difficult to read, I extracted them into separate <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax">SCSS</a> files using Tailwind’s <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@apply</code></a> directive (see files under the <a href="https://github.com/paulfioravanti/sentia-coding-test/tree/main/app/javascript/stylesheets"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/javascript/stylesheets/</code></a> directory). I think I will likely continue to use this kind of strategy in the future with Tailwind class strings.</p> <p>Overall, I am happy to have been able to stand on the Tailwind ecosystem’s shoulders to build out the user interface, and will definitely consider using it again in future projects.</p> <h2 id="data-issues">Data Issues</h2> <p>Turning our gaze towards the provided dataset that the application must be able to import, there is no doubt that the CSV file deliberately contains some corrupt/bad data that you are meant to be able to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming">program defensively</a> against.</p> <p>My general intentions were to only <em>not</em> import an entry where the requirements specifically said not to (i.e. a person without an affiliation should be skipped), and where the data could not be <em>reasonably</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling">munged</a> into an acceptable format.</p> <div style="margin: auto; text-align: center; width: 90%;"> <figure style="display: block"> <img src="/assets/images/2021-05-09/perhaps-archives-incomplete.jpg" alt="80sfy.com screenshot"/> </figure> </div> <h3 id="mis-spellings">Mis-spellings</h3> <p>So, this meant that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lightsaber~!@@@</code> could just be stripped of non-alphanumeric characters and become a valid <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lightsaber</code> weapon, but there were also issues around mis-spellings in the data, where I needed to give the application more knowledge around what kind of values it could expect to find in the CSV file, and what those values actually <em>should</em> be.</p> <p>This occurred in the form of a <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core/Hash.html">Hash</a> that maps values known to be found in the CSV file to their correct values:</p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/services/data_importer/enum_field_parser.rb</code></strong></p> <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">MISSPELLINGS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>I am pretty sure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda">Yoda</a> does not own a pet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt">Jabba</a>, nor is Jabba’s <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sail_barge">mode of transport</a> a retail outlet.</p> <p>Anyway, it is not possible for me to tell whether the introduction of these mis-spellings was deliberate in order to see if a candidate picked up on them, but I am going to wager that these <em>were</em> actually just typos, and the necessity for this kind of handling was not intentional.</p> <h3 id="value-validity">Value Validity</h3> <p>Under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO">C-3PO</a>’s entry, the value for the Vehicle is given as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code>: an obvious ploy to make sure that you do not actually store this value in a Person’s vehicle field.</p> <p>However, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code> is not a valid entry, it then stands to reason that I cannot trust <em>any</em> of those values in the file, and, therefore, need to give the application advance knowledge on <em>what</em> vehicles it can accept as valid.</p> <p>This meant that for a Person entry, I ended up making <em>every value</em> provided for a non-name-related field an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type">enumerated type</a>: both in the application, and at the database level.</p> <p>The fact that there was the spelling mistake for Yoda’s location also made me assign enumerated types for the names of Locations and Affiliations. The application really does have too much advance knowledge of the limited scope of valid values it could get from the CSV file, but I did not see any other way around this while still ensuring data correctness.</p> <h3 id="names">Names</h3> <p>The requirements assume that the name values in the CSV file can be split out into <em>first_name</em> and <em>last_name</em>, which, taken at face value, they certainly can.</p> <p>However, this leads to the issue of having a table that looks like this for some values:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>First Name</th> <th>Last Name</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Princess</td> <td>Leia</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Darth</td> <td>Vader</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Kylo</td> <td>Ren</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Jabba</td> <td>The Hutt</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Some nerds should have looked over this data before it went public because <em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ackchyually">ackchyually</a>…</em></p> <ul> <li>“Princess” is a title, not a name, and “Leia” is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia">Leia Organa</a>’s first name</li> <li><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth">“Darth” is a title</a>, not a name, and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader">Vader</a>” is more like a first name</li> <li>“Ren” is not a last name, but is from <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_Ren">Knights of Ren</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylo_Ren">Kylo Ren</a> used it more like a title once he became the inheritor of Ren’s Knights</li> <li>“The Hutt” is not a last name, but refers to the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hutt">Hutt species</a></li> </ul> <p>So, although not part of the requirements, I figured that this meant the application really needed to deal with the concept of name prefixes (titles etc) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_(name)">suffixes</a> (you may have noticed their inclusion in the screenshot above).</p> <p>Also, for names like Jabba The Hutt and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks">Jar Jar Binks</a>, without the application knowing in advance that “The Hutt” is a suffix, it would not be able to tell the which words in either of those names comprise the <em>first_name</em> or <em>last_name</em>.</p> <p>The ability to deal with the name situation was made a bit more straightforward thanks to Ruby 3.0’s <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0.0/doc/syntax/pattern_matching_rdoc.html">pattern matching</a> capabilities.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>A few notes about this code:</p> <ul> <li>The code that assigns to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@people</code> instance variable is written in a style mimicking the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/enumerables-and-streams.html#the-pipe-operator">Elixir pipeline operator</a>, through the use of Ruby’s <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-then"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kernel#then</code></a> method (aka <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core/Kernel.html#method-i-yield_self"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kernel#yield_self</code></a>). The collection of people that originally gets fetched from the database goes through a series of transformations (filtered via search -&gt; sorted -&gt; paginated -&gt; decorated) before being handed off to the view, so I thought this way of writing the main controller code would indicate that most clearly and explicitly.</li> <li>I would have liked to have had the database do the sorting for me, rather than do it in Ruby-land, but the fact that sorting needed to happen on values contained in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code>’s associations (locations and affiliations), made it untenable.<br/> <strong>UPDATE 3 August 2021</strong> <em>Narrator: <a href="https://www.paulfioravanti.com/blog/coding-test-review-sentia/#update-3-august-2021-ordering-in-the-database">it wasn’t untenable</a></em></li> <li>I originally had the implementation code for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort_direction</code> up in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ApplicationController</code>, since it is not specific to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code>; putting it there would, I think, be considered Rails convention for code of that nature. But, rather than counting on someone looking at a method call, which has no local definition, and then <em>implicitly knowing</em> that its definition could come from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#Subclasses_and_superclasses">superclass</a>, I decided to extract it into a small, named service module (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortDirection</code>), so there is an <em>explicit</em> call-out (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SortDirection.determine</code>). I do not generally like using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">inheritance</a>, and will try and avoid it where I can.</li> <li>I created a small <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Paginator</code> service module with the intention of keeping knowledge about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kaminari</code> restricted to it. Who knows, maybe I might want to change over to something like <a href="https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate</a> one day, and organising the code like this, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">Adapter pattern</a>, will mean no changes will be required in the controller (yes, fine, guilty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI</a> since this just a coding test, but I have no regrets…).</li> <li>Both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort_column</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort_direction</code> are needed in the view, as well as in the controller. I have seen many codebases use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">encapsulation</a>-busting <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/AbstractController/Helpers/ClassMethods.html#method-i-helper_method"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helper_method</code></a> method to allow controllers and views to share methods (I even used it in earlier iterations of this code). However, since decorators are being used in this application, this can be avoided by explicitly passing in whatever extra controller information is needed in presentation logic via a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">context</code> hash, that is only accessible within the confines of the decorator class.</li> </ul> <h3 id="model">Model</h3> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/models/person.rb</code></strong></p> <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>A few notes about this code:</p> <ul> <li>All methods return data only. Nothing here is responsible for returning formatted strings, or anything else that is meant for display purposes: that is strictly the job of the decorators.</li> <li> <p>For functionality related to things like searching or sorting people, for the basic implementations I have done, it would probably be considered Rails convention to have that code live in <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html">Rails concerns</a>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> those modules in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> class to make their methods available.<br/> Like inheritance, I really do not like using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition">composition</a> in this way, as I feel that it is too implicit as well. Perhaps if Ruby had something akin to Elixir’s <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/alias-require-and-import.html#import"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kernel.SpecialForms.import/2</code></a>, where you could explicitly enumerate the methods to import (something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include Search, only: :search_query</code>), then I would probably be more favourably inclined to them.<br/> So, instead, I opted for what I would consider a more Ruby-ish than Rails-ish way of separating the code, through the use of what is apparently called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Partial">partial classes</a> to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</a>: essentially, re-opening the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> class in separate files, and putting code in small <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">private</code> modules for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Search</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sort</code>, and then have the model explicitly call them (eg <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Search.query</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sort.column</code>).

It seems like Postgres should be able to handle this but I might be missing some of the nuance.</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>My rationale for not being able to sort the list of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> records based on values in their associations was that those values were essentially <em>unknowable</em> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> query: it would only be <em>after</em> its associations were fetched from the database that we would be able to loop over them, using Ruby in this case, to find out the exact values of the first affiliation and location names.</p> <p>But, was this rationale correct? I could not help myself, so I took the bait and dove down this rabbit hole to find out. First, though, a minor detour down a separate, but slightly shallower, rabbit hole.</p> <h3 id="ordering-was-broken-anyway">Ordering was broken anyway</h3> <p>On re-opening this codebase, I realised that in my haste to be done with it, I had failed to notice that the location and affiliation names were not <em>always</em> displaying in alphabetical order as expected.</p> <p>There did not seem to be an obvious reason as to why…until I went for a dive in Rails’ Github repo, where it became apparent that there is a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/6769">very long-running issue</a> regarding ordering clauses on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_many</code> relationships being ignored or lost when using an <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-includes"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includes</code></a> statement, which I definitely was in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person.search</code> method.</p> <p>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includes</code> would seem to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11947303/567863">delegate your query generation strategy to Rails itself</a> (ie let Rails decide whether to load association data in a separate query, or in one big join-based query), which is a probably a good rule-of-thumb, because who could just instinctively know that? (Not me). Anyway, it would seem that this ordering issue would require some manual intervention.</p> <p>Figuring out <a href="https://blog.arkency.com/2013/12/rails4-preloading/">which flavour of association preloading</a> would not cause an error, give me the output I expected, and not cause any N+1 issues, was mostly trial and error. I finally got to <a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-preload"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">preload</code></a>, and my house of cards gained a bit of stability with the following change:</p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/models/person.rb</code></strong></p> <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Person</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Okay, this looks like the correct information is at least being returned and populated, so it is a good start.</p> <p>The problem now is that we cannot use this method as-is moving forward: the database is not going to be able to execute this Ruby-land method, passing in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> parameter. We need to have the database fill it in during the course of a lateral join (which will make it <em>unknowable</em> to Ruby). Also, since the join is over a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has_many :through</code> relationship, we will have to change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">joins</code> target to be the join-table (in this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loyalties</code>).</p> <p>Here is how the method will need to change:</p> <p><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app/models/affiliation.rb</code></strong></p> <div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Affiliation</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
