Hi, there! Thanks for your interest about the human behind these writings.

I am a web application software developer, with a particular affinity for the
[Elixir][], [Elm][], and [Ruby][] programming languages.

I love human languages, too, particularly Japanese (I have previously lived in
Japan for 10 years), and Italian (family background).

I am heavily involved in the technical meetup scene in Sydney, being a current
organiser of [Elixir Sydney][], [Elm Sydney][], and [GraphQL Sydney][], as well
as a previous organiser of [Ruby on Rails Oceania (RORO) Sydney][].

Mechanical keyboards are an awesome thing that I am too interested in for my
own good, being a long-time [Ergodox][] user. I am currently attempting to learn
[Plover][] [stenography][], which led me to add the [Georgi][] to my keyboard
mix.

I currently feed myself by working as a Principal Consultant for [Alembic][],
where I make my client's digital dreams come true.

This blog is entirely independent of my paid employment: my posts and comments
are solely my own, and do not necessarily represent my employer's positions,
strategies, or opinions.
