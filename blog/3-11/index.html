As I walked past the reception desk in the lobby and towards the elevators, I glanced up at a TV screen and saw a map of Japan with a big red <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">X</span> to its northeast.</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 60%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2024-03-11/Shindomap_2011-03-11_Tohoku_earthquake.png" alt="Shake map showing distribution of maximum JMA Seismic Intensities by-prefecture for the 11 March 2011"> </figure> </div> <p>Anyone who has lived in Japan is intimately familiar with these images. They are broadcast every time a “significant” quake occurs, but hardly anyone blinks due to complete confidence in modern building construction codes. You enjoy (or ignore) the rumble when it arrives, and then continue on with your day without giving it a second thought.</p> <p>A couple of seconds later, though, this particular <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">X</span> made its presence known. No rocking cradles or light shivers this time: the violent shaking literally knocked everyone off their feet, with people screaming in terror as we grasped for walls in futile attempts to balance ourselves. The huge building I was in suddenly did not feel so stable; I honestly thought it would topple over, flinging me through the huge office kitchen windows, and out over the tracks of Yūrakuchō station.</p> <p>Fortunately, those construction codes held up, and after a few of the most intense minutes of my life, the still upright building’s emergency systems kicked into gear. Elevators were disabled, so we hurriedly descended down the stairs from the twelfth floor in hopes of getting to ground before any potential aftershocks hit.</p> <p>The streets were full of calm but confused people. Mobile phone networks were jammed, leading to massive, but orderly, queues outside public phone booths. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G">3G</a> internet was still usable, though, so social media (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> only for me at the time) became the only usable method for real-time communication.</p> <p>After confirming our colleagues were out of the building, we all agreed that work time was over, and we should make sure our homes and loved ones were safe. So, at least I got out of attending that wretched meeting…</p> <p>However, trains had stopped, bus stop queues were longer than those for phone booths, and roads were at a complete standstill. All normal traffic rules had been disregarded, as streets became pedestrian footpaths, and I merged in with them for my long walk home across Tokyo.</p> <p>As I passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimbashi_Station">Shimbashi Station</a>, I joined a huge crowd of people that had gathered around a big TV screen broadcasting the news, and could not believe what I was seeing.</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 90%"> <figure> <div class="responsive-video-container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/onEGcBBz6VQ?start=12" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <figcaption> Footage of crowds at Shimbashi Station, soon after the earthquake </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>The images of a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami#Tsunami">tsunami</a></em> barreling through rural northern Japan and annihilating everything in its path felt surreal. It took a moment to process that this was indeed reality, and not a scene from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Impact_(film)">Deep Impact</a></em> or <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After_Tomorrow">The Day After Tomorrow</a></em>. After a few minutes, I snapped out of my stupor, picked my jaw up off the ground, and continued walking.</p> <p>My partner, Naoko, was out with friends for the day, and did not use newfangled social media, so getting in direct contact with her was not possible. After a couple hours walk, I managed to find a lonely public phone without a queue, and called her mother on the other side of the country. If Nao reached out there, I wanted her to know that I was safe, and that we should just try and meet back at our apartment.</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 90%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2024-03-11/VZPbl.jpg" alt="Just finished legging it to Shibuya from Yurakucho.

I wagered we had enough supplies to last us a week (maybe…? I had never had to judge that before…), but just to make sure, I stopped by several convenience stores and supermarkets, only to be greeted by rows of empty shelves. The city had already been cleaned out.</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 80%"> <figure> <img src="/assets/images/2024-03-11/Japan_earthquake_store_shelves.jpg" alt="Empty instant noodle shelves in a supermarket in Tokyo due to logistic stack and buyout on 16 March 2011, 5 days after the 2011 Sendai earthquake"> <figcaption> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Japan_earthquake_store_shelves.jpg"> Kellykaneshiro </a>, CC0, via Wikimedia Commons </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>I arrived home to discover my bicycle discarded in the park opposite.

The haunting chimes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_Early_Warning_(Japan)">Earthquake Early Warning</a> system gave us a few seconds notice to brace ourselves before another round of ground turbulence. It would have been a luxury if another huge earthquake was the only thing we had to worry about, but all the news about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_accident">problems at nuclear power plants</a> had us anxious about whether we were actually witnessing the literal end of Japan.</p> <div class="centered-image" style="width: 90%"> <figure> <div class="responsive-video-container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NWSIQgpCdyE?start=12" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <figcaption> The chimes of incoming doom </figcaption> </figure> </div> <p>At the very least, the possibility we would have to flee from Tokyo felt very real, so we packed some bags full of basic necessities, and left them by our front door, ready to go should we need to leave quickly.</p> <p>When images of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant">Fukushima Daiichi</a>’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster_(Unit_3_Reactor)#Explosion">Unit 3 Reactor hydrogen explosion</a> flashed across our screen on the afternoon of March 14, we felt the overwhelming need to go.

But, if we ever end up living there again, we like to think we will be much better prepared for disasters, and certainly provide our full attention to all the inevitable earthquake warnings.</p> </section> <footer class="page__meta"> <p class="page__taxonomy"> <strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-tags" aria-hidden="true"></i> Tags: </strong> <span itemprop="keywords"> <a href="/tags/japan" class="page__taxonomy-item p-category" rel="tag">japan</a> </span> </p> <p class="page__date"><strong><i class="fas fa-fw fa-calendar-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> Updated:</strong> <time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-03-11">March 11, 2024</time></p> </footer> <section class="page__share"> <h4 class="page__share-title">Share on</h4> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=paulfioravanti&amp;text=3.11%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulfioravanti.com%2Fblog%2F3-11%2F" class="btn btn--twitter" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'window', 'left=20,top=20,width=500,height=500,toolbar=1,resizable=0'); return false;" title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Twitter</span></a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulfioravanti.com%2Fblog%2F3-11%2F" class="btn btn--facebook" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'window', 'left=20,top=20,width=500,height=500,toolbar=1,resizable=0'); return false;" title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-facebook" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Facebook</span></a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulfioravanti.com%2Fblog%2F3-11%2F&amp;title=3.11" class="btn btn--reddit" title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-reddit" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> Reddit</span></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulfioravanti.com%2Fblog%2F3-11%2F" class="btn btn--linkedin" onclick="window.open(this.href, 'window', 'left=20,top=20,width=500,height=500,toolbar=1,resizable=0'); return false;" title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-linkedin" aria-hidden="true"></i><span> LinkedIn</span></a> </section> <nav class="pagination"> <a href="/blog/amazon-prime-localisation-fail/" class="pagination--pager" title="Amazon Prime’s Localisation Fail ">Previous</a> <a href="#" class="pagination--pager disabled">Next</a> </nav> </div> <div class="page__comments"> <h4 class="page__comments-title">Leave a comment</h4> <section id="disqus_thread"></section> </div> </article> <div class="page__related"> <h2 class="page__related-title">You may also enjoy</h2> <div class="grid__wrapper"> <div class="grid__item"> <article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"> <div class="archive__item-teaser"> <img src="/assets/images/2024-02-21/frank-mckenna-JB92NeJSxW4-unsplash.jpg" alt="man riding bike and woman running holding flag of USA"> </div> <h2 class="archive__item-title no_toc" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/amazon-prime-localisation-fail/" rel="permalink">Amazon Prime’s Localisation Fail </a> </h2> <p class="page__meta"> <span class="page__meta-date"> <i class="far fa-fw fa-calendar-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> <time datetime="2024-02-21T15:30:00+11:00">February 21, 2024</time> </span> <span class="page__meta-sep"></span> <span class="page__meta-readtime"> <i class="far fa-fw fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 3 minute read </span> </p> <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">Does Prime have an unconscious bias hard coded in its media descriptions? </p> </article> </div> <div class="grid__item"> <article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"> <div class="archive__item-teaser"> <img src="/assets/images/2024-02-04/doc-brown-cable-connect.jpg" alt="Doc Brown from the movie Back to the Future connecting a plug and socket"> </div> <h2 class="archive__item-title no_toc" itemprop="headline"> <a href="/blog/creating-plover-plugins-python/" rel="permalink">Creating Plover Plugins with Python </a> </h2> <p class="page__meta"> <span class="page__meta-date"> <i class="far fa-fw fa-calendar-alt" aria-hidden="true"></i> <time datetime="2024-02-04T21:35:00+11:00">February 4, 2024</time> </span> <span class="page__meta-sep"></span> <span class="page__meta-readtime"> <i class="far fa-fw fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i> 39 minute read </span> </p> <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description">Level up your steno chording with the power of Python!
