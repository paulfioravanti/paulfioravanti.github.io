      # Explanations for flags:
      # --allow-hash-href - Build will fail on the first and last post entries
      # if this isn't allowed since there will be previous and next buttons
      # that have 'links to nowhere'.
      # --ignore-urls "/localhost/,..." - Posts have explicit references to
      # localhost, so don't consider them proper external links that need to
      # go anywhere.
      # --ignore-status-codes "999" - LinkedIn doesn't seem to like crawlers,
      # and hence sends back 999 errors, even if the link is valid.
      # --disable-external - Only use this if the build fails unreasonably on
      # external links
      # --no-enforce-https - There are just some links that are not secure or
      # they don't redirect to a secure version etc
      # --no-check-external-hash - This is the flag I'd like to remove
      # eventually. It would be possible to slowly fix the problem URLs over
      # time
      # NOTE: If new tags are introduced via a post, htmlproofer will need to be
      # disabled for a build in order to proceed forward
      # NOTE 4: The minimal-mistakes-generated 404 page seems to have a #main
      # hash href to nowhere, so ignore all #main hash links for now; I don't
      # have any that I've created in any pages that I control.
