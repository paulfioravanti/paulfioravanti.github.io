/* CUSTOMISATION: Add colors around a Reddit social sharing button.
 * Rather than copy the entire Minimal Mistakes _sass/ directory into the local
 * app as mentioned here (https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/),
 * instead copy code that generates the styles for the social media links from
 * https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes/_buttons.scss#L45
 * and just customise explicitly for Reddit. Note that $reddit-color already
 * exists within the MM theme.
